      <h3>Regular Expression Matching (Regex)</h3>
      			
      <p>When we need to convert plain text or other digital text files into XML, we look for
         strategies to convert patterns into markup. For example, there may be clear signals
         in the text to show us divisions between sections (as in chapter breaks in a book,
         or act and scene divisions in a play), and we might be able to tell from patterns
         of line breaks where paragraph divisions fall. To help us identify, match, and locate
         all of these in a file at once (instead of one at a time), we use <strong>regular expressions</strong>, which are basically <em>patterns to match strings of text</em>. There are many slightly different varieties of regular expressions used in different
         coding and programming environments, and we will be using one of these that is standard
         for our XML editing work and the &lt;oXygen/&gt; editor we are using.
      </p>
      			
      <p>We use regular expression matching in what we call <em>up-conversion</em> from text to XML, and we also use it sometimes when we write XSLT to transform XML-to-XML,
         when we need to add markup based on particular patterns we can locate in the text.
         (For example, we might find that all the dates in a document are written in the same
         format and wrapped in square brackets, and we can quickly use regular expression matching
         to distinguish dates from other kinds of square-bracketed material by identifying
         the brackets and a pattern of numbers and hyphens. We locate and alter those dates
         with regular expressions either while coding an XML file or in up-converting a plain
         text file.)
      </p>
      			
      <p>In &lt;oXygen/&gt;, look at the Find/Replace window, select the checkbox next to “Regular
         Expressions” in the Options menus, and try typing a backslash character ( <span class="code">\</span> ) into the Find window to bring up a short scrollable list of regular expression
         patterns. There are many others we can use, and we tend to look these up and deploy
         them as needed (rather than memorizing a long list). We use this handy <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html">Regular Expressions Info Quick Start Guide</a> very frequently, and it’s a great place for you to start learning and looking up
         regular expression patterns. The regex expressions we are listing on this page are
         those we use frequently in our projects. There are other convenient listings online,
         such as <a href="http://regexlib.com/CheatSheet.aspx">The Regular Expression Library at RegExLib.com</a> , or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Wikipedia’s Regular Expression page</a> which may also be helpful. In the next section, we’ll discuss some basic starting
         points and procedures we commonly use in our <em>up-conversion</em> work.
      </p>
      		
      		
      <h3>Autotagging: Up-conversion from Plain Text</h3>
      			
      <p>When we begin converting text files to XML, we start in the &lt;oXygen/&gt; window, and
         we try to show all the special formatting characters in the document. In &lt;oXygen/&gt;,
         go to <strong>Options -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Editor: Whitespaces:</strong> and mark to <strong>Show TAB and SPACE marks</strong>. 
      </p>
      			
      <p>We then go to the Find/Replace window (CTRL+F on a PC computer, or on the “Find” dropdown
         menu), and <strong>do the following:</strong></p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li>Select Case sensitive</li>
         					
         <li>Select Wrap around</li> 
         				
         <li>Select Regular expression</li> 
         			
         <li>Important: At least at first, we suggest you <strong>deselect</strong> "Dot matches all." The “dot” represents any character, and it can be very powerful
            or a little unwieldy! When “Dot matches all” is selected, it includes newline characters,
            and so if you wrote <span class="code">.+</span> to match more than one character, it could match an entire document, what we call
            a <em>greedy match</em>. When we deselect “dot matches all,” it matches any character within a line, and
            is typically easier to maneuver! That said, there will be times that "Dot matches
            all" is useful, in combination with other expressions.
         </li>
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <p>We typically do the following in the Find/Replace window, first working on changing
         special characters not permitted in XML content, <strong>working with ampersands first</strong>. (The order is important here, because you don’t want to change ampersands twice
         when you’re working on the angle bracket characters (if you have them). If you do
         the angle brackets first, you then leave those new ampersand characters designating
         the left and right brackets open for conversion when you only want the real ampersands
         by themselves. Make sense?)
      </p>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li>Change &amp; to &amp;amp; </li>
         				
         <li>Then change &lt; to &amp;lt; and &gt; to &amp;gt;</li>
         				
         <li>Look for ways to condense multiple blank lines, but only after analyzing your document
            and determining which ones should be kept as markers of, say, section breaks:
            					We typically look for something like this, hunting for “newline” characters,
            <span class="code">\n</span>: <br />
            					<span class="code">\n{3,} or \n\n\n+</span> in the Find window, and replace with <span class="code">\n\n</span>, or whatever makes sense to you!
            				
         </li>
         				
         <li>While it may make the must sense to save this for last, you will need to (manually)
            <strong>add a root element</strong> to surround everything and make an XML file.
         </li>
         			
      </ol>
      			
      <h4>Useful Regex Pattern Symbols:</h4>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li><span class="code">\n</span> =new line character (in RegEx)  Example: replace \n with &lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;item&gt;
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">\t</span> = select tab
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">\s</span> = selects any white-space character (including tabs and new lines). In the Replace
            window, use the space-bar to insert spaces.
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">\d</span> = select digit
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">\D</span> = select non-digit (note upper-case)
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">\w </span>= select word (or alphanumeric) character, either a letter or a number
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">\W</span> = select non-word character (note upper-case)
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">^ </span>= beginning of line.
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">$</span> =end of a line
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">.</span> = the dot: Matches any character except new line. Selects any character within a
            line as long (<strong>as long as you do NOT check “dot matches all”</strong> in Find &amp; Replace. If “dot matches all,” this will select line breaks too.)
         </li>
         				
         				
         			
      </ul>
      			
      			
      <h4>Indicating How Many, Either <span class="code">|</span> Or, and Character Sets <span class="code">[ ]</span>:
      </h4>
      			
      		
      <ul>
         
         			
         <li><span class="code">?</span> = used after a character, picks up zero or 1 of it: so <span class="code">colou?r</span> matches both “color” and “colour”
         </li>
         			
         			
         <li><span class="code">*</span> =used after a character, picks up zero or more of it: (the character may or may not
            be there, and maybe there’s more than one of it). So <span class="code">\w\s\d*</span> picks up a letter followed by a space, as well as a letter followed by a space and
            a number. 
         </li>
         			
         			
         <li><span class="code">+</span> =used after a character, picks up 1 or more of it: For example, <span class="code">\d+</span> picks up either one or more digits, 2 and 25 and 65746, etc.
         </li>
         			
         			
         <li><span class="code">|</span> = (the pipe): selects one OR the other:  <span class="code">grey|gray</span> or <span class="code">gr(e|a)y</span> are each patterns that will match either grey or gray.
         </li>
         			
         			
         <li><span class="code">[ ]</span> matches any ONE character enclosed. Example: <span class="code">[0-9]</span> will select the first single digit from 0-9 that it finds. <span class="code">[IVXLC]+</span> is handy for picking up one or more Roman Numerals, but be careful because this will
            also pick up "I" when it’s not a Roman Numeral but the first-person pronoun: (I, as
            in myself). <span class="code">[^IVXLC]</span> will select anything but these characters.
         </li>
         		
      </ul>
      			
      <h4>Escaping Regex's Special Characters (When You Need To Find a Square Bracket, Period,
         Asterisk, Question Mark, Etc.)
      </h4>
      		     
      <p>Because characters like square brackets, asterisks, and question marks have special
         meaning in regular expressions, in order to search for a literal square bracket, asterisk,
         or question mark, you need to <em>escape</em> the regex character by using a backslash ( <span class="code">\</span> ). The following characters need to be escaped with a backslash if you need to find
         the literal character in your text:
      </p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li>the backslash itself: ( <span class="code">\</span> )
         </li>
         			
         <li>the caret ( <span class="code">^</span> )
         </li>
         				
         <li>the dollar sign ( <span class="code">$</span> )
         </li>
         				
         <li>the pipe ( <span class="code">|</span> )
         </li>
         				
         <li>the dot ( <span class="code">.</span> )
         </li>
         				
         <li>the question mark ( <span class="code">?</span> )
         </li>
         				
         <li>the asterisk ( <span class="code">*</span> )
         </li>
         				
         <li>the opening and closing parentheses ( <span class="code">(</span> and <span class="code">)</span> )
         </li>
         				
         <li>the opening square bracket ( <span class="code">[</span> ), and the opening curly brace ( <span class="code">{</span> )
         </li>
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <p>So, for example, in order to search for a string of alphanumeric characters followed
         by a literal period, we would write the following expression:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code">
         				<span class="code">\w+\.</span>
         			
      </div>
      			
      <p>The "backslash w plus" looks up any one or more alphaumeric characters, and the backslash
         dot looks for the literal period. This might look a little confusing at first, since
         we use the backslash to introduce specific kinds of regular expression characters
         (<span class="code">\d</span>, <span class="code">\w</span>, etc.). It might help to think of using the backslash as an escape character whenever
         you need to locate a character that means something special on its own in regular
         expressions. 
      </p>
      		
      			
      <h4>How to Use Parenthetical Grouping in the Find Window and Select Groups with Backreferences
         in the Replace Window:
      </h4>
      			
      <p>When we group patterns in the Find window with parentheses, we can use <strong>backreferences</strong> to select parenthetical groupings by number in the Replace window. We apply a set
         of <strong>capturing parentheses</strong> to isolate some parts of a pattern we find, if we want to exclude the rest when we
         go to replace.
      </p>
      			
      <ul>	
         <li><span class="code">( )</span> matches and captures all text enclosed. Groups a collection of characters together
            in the “Find” window so you can select it in the “Replace” window. We presume here
            that you set these parenthetical groups side by side, rather than nest them inside
            each other, so that the groupings read from left to right. 
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">\1</span> =under “Replace with”, this represents the first instance of text captured using
            ( ), above, under “Text to find”.
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">\2</span> =second ( ) instance captured, as above   
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">\3</span> =third ( ) instance captured, as above, etc...
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">\0</span> =capture the entire match regardless of parentheses.
         </li>
      </ul>
      			
      <p>Note that you can use backreferences in any order, and repeat them as needed when
         you are making replacements, so you can thoroughly remix the regex patterns you’ve
         grouped! For examples of backreferencing, see <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/backref.html">the Regular-expressions.info page on the subject</a>.
      </p>
      			
      			
      			
      <p>For example, I’ve just gone hunting through our <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">Georg Forster voyage file</a> to see if I can find all the references to days that take this verbal form: the 23rd
         of April (or the 15th, the 2nd, or the 3rd of whatever month and/or year). Let’s say
         I wanted to isolate only the numbers and not the letters (as in, simply, 23, 15, 2,
         3), and wrap those in an element I’ll call <span class="code">&lt;day&gt;</span>, and then I also want to keep the rest of that text to immediately follow? What I
         want to do is change this form: <strong>23rd</strong>, into this: <span class="code">&lt;day&gt;</span>23<span class="code">&lt;/day&gt;</span><strong>rd</strong> . That’s a perfect opportunity to use parenthetical grouping in Find and Replace,
         like this:
         			
      </p>
      		
      <div class="code">	
         <ul>
            				
            <li><strong>Find window:</strong> <span class="code">(\d\d*)([a-z]+)</span>
               				
               <p>Notice how we’re applying parentheses here to isolate the numerical portion, and then
                  a second set to surround the lower-case character set.
               </p>
               				
            </li>
            				
            <li><strong>Replace window:</strong> <span class="code">&lt;day&gt;\1&lt;/day&gt;\2</span>
               				
               <p>Here, I indicate that the “day” element is to sit around the first parenthetical grouping
                  I’ve isolated: just the numbers. Then I give the second parenthetical grouping that’s
                  going to sit right outside. This works in my markup to help me hold only the numerical
                  portion of the date inside a handy XML element.
               </p>
            </li>
            			
         </ul>
      </div>
      			
      <p>Note that you might want to use parentheses for reasons other than capturing and backreferencing.
         For example, you might group a series of options marked with vertical pipes ( <span class="code">|</span> ) inside a parenthetical group in order to set this group of options apart from the
         rest of your non-optional regex pattern. In this case, you’re using <strong>non-capturing parentheses</strong>, but you can hold capturing parentheses inside, and when you refer to them, you still
         refer to them working from left to right, from inside the non-capturing parentheses.
         This can get a little complicated, and we refer you to the Regular-Expressions.info
         page on <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/branchreset.html">"Branch Reset Groups"</a> for details and examples.
      </p>
      			
      <h3>Thinking Your Way Through an Autotagging Challenge:</h3>
      		
      			
      <p>There’s no single <em>one</em> way to do autotagging on a file: There are always options! Here are some hints:
      </p>
      			
      <ol>
         <li>When you begin, one of the things you do is analyze the structure of the document
            (do a “document analysis”) to notice what regular patterns you can find. You don’t
            want to be working on this line by line from the top to the bottom, because the point
            of autotagging is to collect all the <strong>related</strong> kinds of things across the whole document. Instead, the big decision you need to
            make is whether to work from the <strong>outside in</strong>, or the <strong>inside out</strong>. 
            			
            <p>In other words, do you try to capture all the big outer elements first (the ones that
               hold most of the other elements inside), and then work your way in? Or go the other
               way, and start from the inside elements (all the items inside the lists, for example)?
               Either approach can work, and much depends on the patterns you spot as you analyze
               your text file.
            </p>
         </li>
         			
         <li>Sometimes you “munge” your file accidentally and need to take steps backward, or start
            over with a fresh copy of the file--that has happened to us! It can be frustrating--take
            a break and try it again. (It’s also very rewarding when you get it just right!)
         </li>
         			
         <li>Try a <strong>close-open</strong> strategy: Quite often, the place where you open a new element is ALSO the place where
            an old element closes. Can you do two things at once? Look for opportunities to close
            a tag when you open a new one (or vice versa).
         </li>
         				
         <li>When you work on autotagging, you usually do some work at the top and/or bottom of
            your file to change or eliminate a few things at the start or toward the end of your
            process. For example, if you try the <strong>close-open</strong> strategy to indicate at the start of a <span class="code">&lt;list&gt;</span> element where the previous <span class="code">&lt;list&gt;</span> ended, you’d write the code like this: <span class="code">&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list&gt;[regex pattern here]</span>. When you’ve made your replacements, you’ll always have an extra closing <span class="code">&lt;/list&gt;</span> tag ahead of your first <span class="code">&lt;list&gt;</span> element, but you can easily just manually delete this one rogue tag when you’re cleaning
            up your file.
         </li>
         				
         <li>When up-converting to XML, think about whether you really need or want to preserve
            things in your text files that function as <strong>pseudo-markup</strong>, that is, things that functioned like structural markup to indicate things like quotations,
            section divisions, separators between paragraphs. XML tags can be used to mark all
            these things, and you can apply HTML and CSS later to add dividers as you wish when
            you publish this in electronic form. But keep in mind as you analyze and convert your
            documents that you don’t really need to preserve formatting for the sake of preserving
            it. Remember that you want your XML markup (your tags themselves) to hold meaningful
            information about the structure and content of your document, so you do not really
            need to include the pseudo-markup in the original text. Systematically removing that
            pseudo-markup is part of your up-conversion process.

         </li>
         			
         <li><span class="code">x{2,}</span> two or more x’s
         </li>
         			
         <li><span class="code">p{3}</span>	Exactly 3 p’s
         </li>
         			
         <li><span class="code">q{3,}</span>	3 or more q’s
         </li>
         			
         <li><span class="code">B{3,5}</span> 3, 4 or 5 B’s
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">^(.+)$</span> Since a caret ( <span class="code">^</span> ) indicates the start of a line, and the dollar sign ( <span class="code">$</span> ) indicates the end of a line, and the <span class="code">.+</span> indicates the presence of some characters inside, this pattern selects lines that
            contain text (and ignores any lines that are empty). You could run a Replace to work
            with the capturing parentheses and wrap that content inside an element that makes
            sense (like <span class="code">&lt;item&gt;</span>). In the Replace window, we’d write <span class="code">&lt;item&gt;\1&lt;/item&gt;</span> to tag the text inside the line.
         </li>
         				
         			
         <li><span class="code">^[IVX]+\. .+$</span>  =beginning of a line, any roman numeral less than 50, exactly one literal period,
            exactly one literal space character, then all characters up to the end of the line
         </li>
         			
         <li>\<span class="code">s\s</span> Find any sequence of two white-space characters (space, tab, new-line). If you’re
            running a Find and Replace, you might replace these multiple white-space characters
            with a single <span class="code">\s</span>, or use the spacebar.
         </li>
         				
         <li><strong>Replacing line breaks:</strong>: Match the <span class="code">\n</span> (or newline character) in order to "consume" and replace a linebreak. It won’t work
            to try to replace <span class="code">^</span>  and <span class="code">$</span>, which indicate the start and end of lines, because these are not characters that
            can be replaced; they are merely <em>anchors</em> or indicators.

         <li>Read about how to write a <strong>Lookahead</strong> and <strong>Lookbehind</strong> regex, to look for a pattern of something ahead or behind of a character, or something
            that is NOT ahead or behind a character. Read about it and look at examples on <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html">the Regular-Expressions.info guide to "Lookaround."</a></li>

      <h3>Regular Expressions in XPath and XSLT</h3>
      			
      <p>There are XPath functions dedicated to matching and converting regular expressions:
         These include the following:
      </p>
      				
      <ul>
         					
         <li><span class="code">matches()</span>: This takes two arguments: you designate a first string, and then a second that indicates
            a particular pattern you’re trying to find inside it. For example, if you were looking
            in all the paragraphs of a document coded with &lt;p&gt; to find any paragraphs that contain
            at least a single digit): 
            						
            <div class="code">//p[matches(., "\d")]</div>
            						
            					
            <p>Remember, the dot in the XPath indicates that you’re looking at the string of text
               inside each paragraph in turn, and that is the first string. Then the second string
               is the  regular expression pattern <span class="code">\d</span>, which indicates a pattern to search for any numerical digit inside the string of
               text in the paragraph.
            </p>
            						
            <p>Note: There are three other related XPath functions that work like <span class="code">matches()</span>, only these work on literal strings, not regex patterns. We include them here because
               you may find them useful to think about in connection with matches():
            </p>
            					
            <ul>
               						
               <li><span class="code">contains()</span>: Tests whether the first string contains a particular <strong>literal string</strong>. To adapt our example above, say we are looking for all the paragraphs that contain
                  a mention of the specific year 1995. We’d use <span class="code">contains()</span> much like we’d write <span class="code">matches()</span>, but this time using the literal characters. 
                  							
                  <div class="code">//p[contains(., "1995")]</div>
                  							
                  <p>(Note: You can actually write matches() to look for a literal string as well as a
                     regex pattern, since one kind of regex actually is a literal string. So, of these
                     two, matches() is the more adaptable XPath function, and contains() can only match
                     on literal strings.)
                  </p>
               </li>
               						
               <li><span class="code">starts-with()</span>: Tests whether the first string <em>starts with</em> a particular literal string.
               </li>
               						
               <li><span class="code">ends-with()</span>: Tests whether the first string <em>ends with</em> a particular literal string.
               </li>
               					
            </ul>
            					
            					
         </li> 
         					
         <li><span class="code">replace()</span>: This function has three parts in its parenthetical expression: <span class="code">replace(string, regex, replacement-string)</span>, and works like this, for example, if we wanted to go look in any <span class="code">&lt;author&gt;</span> element for capital letters, and replace them all with literal asterisk characters:
            					
            <div class="code">//author/replace(., "[A-Z]", "*")</div>
            						
            <p>Here, the regex pattern is described in the middle expression to define the pattern
               we’re looking for, and it’s a defined <em>character set</em>: This says, look for any single character from the set <span class="code">[A-Z]</span> and replace it with a “splat” or an asterisk. When I ran this XPath expression on
               our <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">ForsterGeorgComplete.xml file</a>, I converted <strong>Forster, Georg</strong> in an author tag to <strong>*orster, *eorg</strong>. (Fortunately this was just a tester XPath, and it didn’t change the string of text
               in my file, just in the XPath results window.)
            </p>
            					
         </li>
         					
         <li><span class="code">tokenize()</span>: This one is extremely handy for fine-tuning XML markup: We use the <span class="code">tokenize()</span> function for a sort of surgical precision in our documents, to break patterns into
            parts (or “tokens”), by dividing on a particular regex pattern: <span class="code">tokenize(string, regex-pattern)</span>, and the output breaks my string into parts that I can grab and work with. For example,
            I’ll go looking for <span class="code">&lt;author&gt;</span> elements again to grab their text, and <strong>tokenize</strong> it on white space, defined as a regex pattern by <span class="code">\s+</span>:
            					
            						
            <div class="code">//author/tokenize(., "\s+")</div>
            						
            <p>When I run this in the XPath window, I return (among other things), a list that separates
               “George” from “Forster.”. (When we tokenize on white space, it’s a good idea to work
               in the option for <em>one or more</em> spaces, in case we have a line break as well as a space character separating two
               parts of a thing.)
            </p>
            					
         </li>
         
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <p>In XSLT, there is an element, <span class="code">xsl:analyze-string</span> that we use for manipulating regular expressions, and you can read more about it
         in the Michael Kay book if you have it, or on the Obdurodon site’s <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/analyze-string.html">tutorial on using analyze-string</a>.
