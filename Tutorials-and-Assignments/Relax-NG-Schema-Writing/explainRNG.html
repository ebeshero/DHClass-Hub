      <p>When we began writing XML, we learned about <strong>well-formedness</strong>: that
         				all XML documents must have a single root element, all elements must be properly
         				nested, and element and attribute tags must be written correctly so that a computer
         				can parse a file as XML. But we also code XML documents for human beings wishing
         to
         				work in an organized and systematic way, and for this reason, we write
         					<strong>schema</strong> rules and we apply <strong>schema files</strong> in our
         				projects to check our XML against the rules we create. When we check our XML files
         				against a set of schema rules, we are checking their <strong>validity</strong>. We
         				can use validity checks to make sure we’re spelling element names properly,
         				writing attribute names and values consistently, and nesting elements in a way
         that
         				makes sense to us that we want to hold consistent: as for example, always nesting
         a
         					<span class="code">&lt;title&gt;</span> element inside a <span class="code">&lt;heading&gt;</span> element.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Writing schema rules is closely related to performing a <strong>document
            					analysis</strong> to record the key features of a text that you wish to mark up
         				in XML. When you write a schema, you formalize those rules. Over the course of
         a
         				project, people tend to modify their coding rules and frequently revise their
         schema
         				files. In turn coders on a project apply updated schema rules to update their
         				coding, change their tag names, the order of particular tags, the values they
         are
         				inputting for attributes, etc. Knowing how to write a schema and knowing how to
         				apply it and update it can thus give you the know-how necessary for managing and
         				streamlining your work, and a team’s work on an XML project.

      <h3>Relax NG: A Little Background</h3>
      			
      <p><strong>RELAX NG</strong> is an acronym for <strong>RE</strong>gular
         					<strong>LA</strong>nguage description for <strong>X</strong>ML
         					<strong>N</strong>ext <strong>G</strong>eneration, and as the name implies, it
         				took some “generational” cycles or a long period of time to develop,
         				roughly concurrent with the early history of XML. There are a couple of different
         				“syntaxes” for writing Relax NG, an XML-based version and a Compact
         				version. The XML-based version is written as XML code with elements and attributes,
         				which makes it a little more difficult to write and follow than the Compact version,
         				so we’ve opted for the Compact version for our work. Later on, we’ll be
         				learning an XML-based schema language called <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/schematron-intro.html">Schematron</a>
         <!--Insert Schematron Link Here --> that we can use for specialized,
         				targeted needs in project development. For now, we want you to be aware that there
         				are a few different ways to write schema languages for XML projects, and that
         we are
         				learning one specific way that was designed from the outset to be “simple and
         				easy to learn,” that is, optimized for organizing and managing XML projects.

      <h3>Relax NG Compact Syntax: How We Write It</h3>
      			
      <p>In the Compact Syntax of Relax NG, we write rule statements in the form of
         					<strong>named patterns</strong>, that look like this:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> label = type name {content} </div>
      			
      <p>Each named pattern in Compact Syntax takes this basic form: The <span class="code">label</span> is a name for the XML “object” you’re
         				describing; <span class="code">type</span> indicates what kind of object it is, an
         				element or an attribute; <span class="code">name</span> is the literal name of the
         				element or attribute; and <span class="code">{content}</span> indicates what the
         				element or attribute is allowed to contain (such as: other elements, an attribute
         				value of a particular kind, an attribute, text, etc. The <span class="code">label</span> can be anything you find convenient, but it’s usually
         				easiest for us to deal with when the label is the same as the <span class="code">name</span>. Here’s an example in practice, from the very beginning of a
         				file: 
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> start = root <br /> root = element root {head, body} 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Our first rule in Relax-NG needs to indicate how we begin, and it always has the
         				label “start,” which is a <em>reserved word</em> for this purpose in
         				Relax-NG. Here, we’re defining the root element for our XML file, and
         				we’re simply using the label and element name “root” for it. (If
         				you wanted to call the root element something else, of course you can, and this
         is
         				the place to specify that. So if you wanted to call it, “letter,”
         				you’d write: 
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> start = letter <br /> letter = element letter {head, body} 
      </div>
      			
      <p>The second line here defines letter as an element named letter, and it holds inside
         				the curly braces <span class="code">{ }</span> what the root element is allowed to
         				contain: in this case exactly one <span class="code">head</span> and one <span class="code">body</span>. We need to write more rules to define <span class="code">head</span> and <span class="code">body</span> as elements, and to
         				specify what they will contain.
      </p>
      			
      <h3>Defining Content Models: <span class="code">{ }</span></h3>
      			
      <p>The part of the rule wrapped in curly braces is called the “content
         				model,” and it’s where we essentially write the rules for what an
         				element or attribute is allowed to contain in our nested XML hierarchy. The words
         				inside the curly braces are, themselves, <span class="code">labels</span> which must
         				be defined somewhere in the schema. The way we write the rule specifies what’s
         				allowed inside, in what order, and how many of it we permit. The order we set
         is
         				determined by our <em>combination indicators</em>, and the quantity we expect is
         				determined by <em>repetition indicators</em>.
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Combination Indicators:</h4>
      			
      <p>We commonly use two combination indicators for multiple kinds of combinations: One
         				kind of combination is a <em>sequence</em>, in which we want elements or attributes
         				to come in a particular order. The second kind of combination is a <em>choice</em>
         				in which we indicate that either one OR another is permitted, but not both. <span class="smaller">(Sidenote: There’s a third kind of combination indicator
            					called “interleave,” which is signalled with an ampersand (<span class="code"> &amp; </span>), but we won’t really need to use it once
            					we show you “grouping” below.)</span>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li><strong>The comma</strong> (<span class="code"> , </span>): This indicates you
            					are requiring a sequence in a particular order. For example: 
            <div class="code">letter = element letter {head, body}</div> In the rule above, the comma
            					indicates that a head must come before a body. 
         </li>
         				
         <li><strong>The “pipe”</strong> or vertical bar (<span class="code"> |
               					</span>): This indicates a choice, either one <span class="code"> | </span>or
            					the other must occur, For example: 
            <div class="code">letter = element letter
               						{head | body}
            </div> In this rule, the pipe indicates that you may either
            					have a head OR a body. You must have one or the other, but not both. There IS
            a
            					way to indicate choice between these two that allows either to appear in any
            					order, but we’ll show you that further along in this tutorial. You need to
            					learn about <em>repetition indicators</em> and <em>grouping</em> first. 
         </li>
         
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <h4>Repetition Indicators</h4>
      			
      <p>We use four repetition indicators, to indicate HOW MUCH of something we will
         				permit:
      </p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li><strong>Nothing at all: </strong> If nothing appears after the word, that means
            					we require one and only one of it. It must show up once, and once only: Example:
            						
            <div class="code">letter = element letter {head, body}</div> In this
            					example, we require exactly one (and only one) head, followed in sequence by
            					exactly one (and only one) body. 
         </li>
         				
         <li><strong>Question Mark: (<span class="code"> ? </span>)</strong>: Zero or one:
            					The item is optional: it may appear zero or one time, but it cannot appear more
            					than once. So, for example: 
            <div class="code">letter = element letter {head?,
               						body}
            </div> Here, we say that the letter element may or may not have one
            					head element inside, but if there <em>is</em> a head, the body element must
            					appear after it. This rule also says that there must be exactly one body within
            					letter (whether there’s a head or not.) 
         </li>
         				
         <li><strong>Plus sign: (<span class="code"> + </span>)</strong>: One or more: There
            					MUST be at least one of this, and it may be repeated. For example: 
            <div class="code"> body = element body {dateline?, salutation?, paragraph+}</div>
            					In this example, we indicate that the element body may or may not contain a
            					single dateline element, followed by a single (optional) salutation element,
            but
            					it MUST contain at least one paragraph and there may be more paragraph elements.
            
         </li>
         				
         <li><strong>Asterisk or “splat”: (<span class="code"> *
                  						</span>)</strong>: Zero or more. This is optional, AND it can be repeated.
            					(The asterisk is very flexible.) Here’s an example from a project that
            					lists individual people’s names (where there must be at least one, but
            					could be more than one), birthplaces and birthdates, and, optionally, events
            in
            					their lives: 
            <div class="code"> person = element person {name+, birthplace,
               						birthday, event*}
            </div> Here, we require that each person element must
            					contain at least one (but maybe more than one) name element; exactly one
            					birthplace element; exactly one birthday element; and zero, one, or more than
            					one event element. Because we’re using the comma, in all these examples
            					we’ve been indicating an expected sequence of elements. 
         </li>
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <h3>Grouping with Parentheses <span class="code">( )</span>
         			
      </h3>
      			
      <p>Using parentheses, we can <strong>group</strong> content items and apply the
         				combination and repetition indicators above to make very precise rules. When we
         use
         				parentheses, these are read by the computer parser from the inside out. For example,
         				here is a rule to control how to organize entries in an XML bibliography citation.
         				Notice the grouping around author | editor: 
      </p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li>
            <div class="code"> bibEntry = element bibEntry { (author | editor)+, title+,
               						publisher, publicationPlace, date } 
            </div> Reading from the inside out, this
            					means we expect either an author OR an editor element as the first element in
            					the sequence. It also means that this choice may be made one or more than one
            					time: so the computer parser can permit an author element as well as an editor
            					element in any combination, as long as there is <strong>at least one author OR
               						at least one editor</strong>. Realize the power of the parentheses: This
            					means, with grouping used together with the “pipe” and a repetition
            					indicator (plus sign or asterisk), we can permit either one or both elements
            to
            					be repeated.
         </li>
         				
         <li>If we use an asterisk instead on our parenthetical grouping, consider how this
            					changes the meaning: 
            <div class="code"> bibEntry = element bibEntry { (author |
               						editor)*, title+, publisher, publicationPlace, date } 
            </div> This would mean
            					we may not have an author or an editor at all, OR we might have multiple of
            					either one. (It’s more flexible than the plus sign, which demands that
            					there be at least one of something at minimum.)
         </li>
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <h3>Rules for Elements, Attributes, Plain Text and Other Data Types</h3>
      			
      <p>So far, we’ve just been showing you rules that involve element names. But
         				schemas need to set rules for all the content of an XML document, and that includes
         				attribute names and values, as well as whether an element contains plain text
         or
         				only other elements, or nothing at all. When an element is permitted to contain
         both
         				plain text as well as other elements and/or attributes, it is said to have <em>mixed
            					content</em>. When it contains nothing at all, as a self-closing element,
         				it’s said to be <em>empty</em>.
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Rules for Elements with Attributes:</h4>
      			
      <p>Here is an example demonstrating a rule for element to contain an attribute, followed
         				by a rule defining the attribute and indicating a closed list of its permitted
         				values:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> location = element location {type, text} <br /> type = attribute type
         				{"astron" | "atmos" | "ocean" | "river" | "lake" | "island" | "mount" } 
      </div>
      			
      <h4>Rules for Empty (Self-Closing) Elements:</h4>
      			
      <p>Elements are empty when they contain no text and no other elements. These are
         				self-closing elements, and here’s an example of how to write a rule for
         				one:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> lineBreak = element lineBreak { empty } </div>
      			
      <p>This uses a special <em>reserved word</em> in Relax NG called <span class="code">empty</span>, used especially for this purpose. If we wanted to designate an
         				element named “empty” we’d need to “escape” the
         				reserve character. (More on this below.)
      </p>
      			
      <p>Empty elements ARE allowed to have attributes, and if we’re using page breaks
         				or line breaks or other “milestone” self-closing elements, we frequently
         				use attributes to hold information. Here’s an example of a rule designating an
         				empty element with attributes: 
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> pageBreak = element pageBreak {n, empty} <br /> n = attribute n
         				{xsd:int} 
      </div>
      			
      <p>In this example, the attribute n is given a special value, <span class="code">xsd:int</span>, which means in must contain an integer (or number). This is an
         				example of using a <strong>data type</strong>, and we’ll give more examples of
         				this below.
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Rules for Text and Mixed Content:</h4>
      			
      <p>We need to designate some elements to contain the text of a document, and to do that
         				Relax NG has a special <em>reserved word</em>, <span class="code">text</span>.
         				(We’re not allowed, without a workaround, to use that reserved word text as an
         				element name, and we’ll show you a couple of workarounds below.) So,
         				let’s say we have an element that we only want to contain plain text.
         				Here’s how we designate it, using the reserve word:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> name = element name {text} </div>
      			
      <p>Often, though, we’ll want to designate an element to contain a mix of plain
         				text, an attribute (or more), and other elements. Imagine a prose paragraph
         				you’ve coded, as a mix of text and elements marking off names, dates,
         				locations, grammar, etc. In these situations, we have an alternate way to designate
         				that text can appear at any point, interspersed with element content: 
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code">paragraph = element paragraph <strong>{</strong>mixed
         					<strong>{</strong>(name | location | date)*<strong>}}</strong></div>
      			
      <p>This is a more complex syntax than you’ve seen before! Let’s walk through
         				it: First, we say that the element paragraph contains mixed content, with the
         word
         				mixed in the <strong>outer set of curly braces</strong>: That word
         				“mixed” indicates there’s plain text floating around in any order
         				with the element content that follows. Notice there’s an <strong>inner set of
            					curly braces</strong> that we always use after mixed, and that contains the
         				element content. We’ll go on to define <span class="code">name</span>, <span class="code">location</span>, and <span class="code">date</span> as elements
         				with their own rules. 
      </p>
      			
      <p>Now, a review of grouping: In the above example, we made this internal grouping:
         					<span class="code">(name | location | date)*</span>. This means that a paragraph
         				may contain none, some, or all three of these element choices, in any order, so
         				it’s a very versatile expression for keeping our options open! How would it be
         				different if we wrote the following? <span class="code">(name | location |
            					date)+</span>
         				<span class="smaller">(Hint: look up at the Grouping section to review
            				this.)</span></p>
      			
      <h4>Data Types (such as unique identifiers, numbers, or standard date entries):</h4>
      			
      <p>We may want to constrain the contents of an element or attribute to specialized kinds
         				of data. For example, if we’re coding a list of people who show up in a big
         				pile of documents, and who might show up under different names, we might want
         to
         				designate a core list of <span class="code">person</span> elements that contain a
         				unique identifier in an attribute value, sort of an id-card in XML to help us
         keep
         				track of them. It’s traditional in XML to designate an @xml:id to hold a
         				unique identifier that cannot be used anywhere else, and for this there’s
         					<strong>a data type called xsd:ID</strong>. Notice two things about this
         				example: 1) Relax NG apparently doesn't permit colons inside labels, so our label
         is
         				simply "xmlid" to escape the problem, and 2) We’ve written this so the
         				identifying info can all be held inside an empty (self-closing) element!)
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> person = element person { xmlid, type, gender, empty }<br /> xmlid =
         				attribute xml:id { xsd:ID }<br /> type = attribute type { text }<br /> gender =
         				attribute gender { "m" | "f" } 
      </div>
      			
      <p>If we want to indicate that an element or an attribute <strong>may only contain a
            					number</strong> (or integer value), use the xsd:int data type:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> year = element year {xsd:int} </div>
      			
      <p>Here are examples of <strong>how we constrain a date element</strong> to contain
         				attributes, either @when to indicate one specific date, OR a pair of attributes,
         				@from and @to, used together to indicate a span of time, like this <span class="code">&lt;date from="1976-07-05" to="1980-08-15"/&gt;</span>. We’re
         				using <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">standard ISO
            					format</a> for dates, which is represented like this: yyyy-mm-dd. However, we
         				might imagine that in a given document, we might not know every part of a date.
         				Maybe we just have a year, or a year and month. There are different data type
         values
         				for each option, which we give below, since this is something we frequently need
         to
         				indicate in our projects. Notice how we’ve written these out as options. The
         				attribute value must be written in one of the three different data type formats:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> date = element date {(when | (from, to)), text} <br /> when =
         				attribute when {xsd:date | xsd:gYearMonth | xsd:gYear} <br /> from = attribute from
         				{xsd:date | xsd:gYearMonth | xsd:gYear} <br /> to = attribute to {xsd:date |
         				xsd:gYearMonth | xsd:gYear} 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Now, that example works just fine, but it's repetitive. We can set a
         					<strong>pattern</strong> in Relax-NG if we create a complicated content model
         				and need to use it on multiple elements or attributes. We show you how below.
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Writing Patterns (so you don't have to repeat yourself):</h4>
      			
      <p>In the previous example we used the same content model repeatedly for three different
         				attributes, and we really don't have to do that. If you've modelled something
         				complicated in your curly braces <span class="code">{ }</span> and want to re-use it
         				on multiple elements or attributes, we recommend setting up a
         					<strong>pattern</strong>, which just involves setting a<strong> label = ( a
            					pattern )</strong>. Note we use <strong>parentheses </strong>for this (not curly
         				braces). Here's how to set and refer to a pattern:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code">
         				<strong>datePattern = (xsd:date | xsd:gYearMonth| xsd:gYear)</strong>
         				<br /> date = element date {(when |(from, to)), empty} <br /> when = attribute when
         				{datePattern}<br /> from = attribute from {datePattern}<br /> to = attribute to
         				{datePattern} 
      </div>
      			
      <h4>Escaping a reserved word so we can use it as a label:</h4>
      			
      <p>If you need to use the word, text, as label in a rule, you’ll have to
         				“escape” it by using a backslash in front, like this: <span class="code">\text</span>. (Or, you can use a different word entirely for the label.) The
         				same goes for the other reserve words in Relax NG, including the word, list.
         				Here’s a link to <a href="http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html#keywords">the complete
            					list of “keywords” (or reserved words) in Relax NG</a>.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Note that when you escape a reserved word, you <strong>only</strong> escape it in the
         				label position, remembering that we use labels at the beginning of a rule and
         refer
         				to them inside the <span class="code">{ }</span> curly braces. Note: You are <em>not
            					permitted</em> to escape the word when it is an element or attribute name: those
         				names must be literal (and the backslash escape character is not needed or allowed
         				there).
      </p>
      			
      <p>Here are some example rules involving us escaping a reserved word. Either approach
         				(version 1 or version 2) is fine; they result in the same thing. <strong>Notice
            					where we use the escape character, and where we don't!</strong></p>
      			
      <p>Version 1 (with the reserved word, list):</p>
      			
      <div class="code"> chapter = element chapter {mixed {(paragraph |
         				<strong>\list</strong>)*}} <br />
         				<strong>\list</strong> = element list {item+}<br /> item = element item {mixed
         					{<strong>\list</strong>*}} 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Version 2 (with the same reserved word, list):</p>
      			
      <div class="code"> chapter = element chapter {mixed {(paragraph |
         					<strong>listing</strong>)*}}<br />
         				<strong>listing</strong> = element list {item+}<br /> item = element item {mixed
         					{<strong>listing</strong>*}} 
      </div>
      			
      <h3>The Big Picture: A Sample XML File, and Its Schema Rule</h3>
      			
      <p>We borrow this sample code, with appreciation, from <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org">Obdurodon</a>, to show you a sample, fairly short XML file, and its Relax NG
         				Schema:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;play&gt;<br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;heading&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;title&gt;The Importance of Being
            					Ernest&lt;/title&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;year&gt;1895&lt;/year&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/heading&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;body&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;quote speaker="Algernon"&gt;I don’t know that I am much
            					interested in your family life, Lane.&lt;/quote&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;quote speaker="Lane"&gt;No, sir; it is not a very
            					interesting subject. I never think of it myself.&lt;/quote&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/body&gt;</span><br /> &lt;/play&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Here’s a complete Relax NG schema for this sample XML file. In order for the
         				schema to be complete and for it to function as a <strong>valid schema</strong> for
         				the XML, it must account for <strong>every</strong> component of the XML document,
         				all of its elements, attributes and text. Our friends at Obdurodon <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/relaxng.html">give an example of the schema below
            					missing one line</a>, and indicate how this will throw off the entire schema
         				validation. Every element and attribute must be defined for your schema to work
         and
         				be valid.
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> start = play <br /> play = element play {heading, body}<br /> heading
         				= element heading {title, year}<br /> title = element title {text}<br /> year =
         				element year {xsd:int}<br /> body = element body {quote*}<br /> quote = element
         				quote {speaker, text}<br /> speaker = attribute speaker {text} 
      </div>
      			
      <h3>Using &lt;oXygen/&gt; to Write a Relax NG Schema</h3>
      			
      <p>To start writing a Relax NG Schema in Compact Syntax, go to File and New, or click
         on
         				the icon like a sheet of paper in the upper left corner. In the menu, look under
         				“New” or “Recently Used” for “RELAX NG Schema -
         				Compact,” and select it and click the “create” button. Just delete
         				all the boilerplate lines at the top of the file and start with a completely blank
         				file. Begin by typing <span class="code">start =</span> and designate your root
         				element as we discussed above. Keep writing until you’ve completely defined
         				rules for the full content of your XML document. (Notice that as you write,
         				&lt;oXygen/&gt; generates errors until you’ve defined each new label you
         				enter.) Save your work somewhere convenient. (We usually save our schema files
         in
         				the same folder as our XML.) 
      </p>
      			
      <h3>How to Associate a Schema and Run a Validation Check in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</h3>
      			
      <p>In order to run a <strong>validation check</strong> on your XML file, you need to
         					<strong>associate</strong> your Relax NG schema with the XML. To do this, in
         				&lt;oXygen/&gt; open the XML file you want to validate. Go to “Document”
         				on the top menu bar, and on the drop-down menu, select “Schema,” and
         				then “Associate Schema.” Then browse for the Relax NG Schema you wrote,
         				select it and click “OK.” When you successfully associate your schema,
         				&lt;oXygen/&gt; inserts a line of code at the top of your document, called a
         				“schema line.”, which looks like this:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code">&lt;?xml-model href="ExampleRelaxNG.rnc"
         				type="application/relax-ng-compact-syntax"?&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>If your document fails its schema validation, the square in the upper left corner
         				turns red (just as it does for a formedness error), only you’ll see a
         				different error message for failing a validity check. To be sure you’re
         				running a validity check (or if you’ve just edited your schema file and want
         				to re-run it), select the icon that looks like a red check-mark on a piece of
         paper,
         				and oXygen will run a fresh validation check. (The keyboard shortcut in Windows
         for
         				running a validation check is Ctrl+Shift+v, and on a Mac the shortcut is
         				Cmd+Shift+v.) <strong>One more thing!</strong> When you've associated a schema once
         				with your XML file, <strong>you don't need to repeat the association!</strong> Once
         				you have your schema line at the top of the XML file, you can simply update your
         				Relax NG file, save it, and simply re-run the validation check in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.
