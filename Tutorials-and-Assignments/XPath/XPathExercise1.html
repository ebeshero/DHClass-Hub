      <p>First of all, download the XML file I have linked here: <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">ForsterGeorgComplete.xml</a>.
         				Open the file in oXygen and work with the XPath 2.0 Window. Respond to the XPath
         questions below in a text file, and <a href="http://courseweb.pitt.edu">upload to
            			Courseweb</a> for this assignment when you're finished.  (Please use an attachment! If you paste
         your answer into
         			the text box, CourseWeb may munch the angle brackets.) Some of these
         			tasks are thought-provoking, and even difficult. If you get stuck, do
         			the best you can, and if you can’t get a working answer, give the
         			answers you tried and explain where they failed to get the results you
         			wanted. Sometimes doing that will help you figure out what’s wrong,
         			and even when it doesn’t, it will help us identify the difficult
         			moments. These tasks require the use of path expressions, predicates,
         			and the functions count() and not(), but they should not require any
         			other XPath functions. There may be more than one possible answer. You may find
         our introductory guide <a href="explainXPath.html">"Follow the XPath!"</a> a helpful resource as you proceed.<br /><br />
         		
         			With the Georg Forster file open in oXygen and using the XPath 2.0
         			browser window in oXygen, construct XPath expressions that will do the
         			following. <b>Be sure to give the FULL XPath expression you used in
            				your answer, and don't just report your results.</b> This way, if the
         			answer is incorrect, we can help explain what went wrong.

      <ol>
         <li>Like most of the long voyage publications, Georg Forster's voyage
            			account is produced in multiple books, and inside each books we find
            			multiple chapters. Both books and chapters are coded with <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span>
            				elements. Take a look at the outline view of the document before you
            				begin to familiarize yourself with the structure of this file, and
            				answer the following:
            				
            <ul>
               <li>How can XPath tell apart the books from the chapters?</li>
               				
               <li>What XPath would find ONLY the books in the file?</li>
               				
               <li>What XPath would find ONLY the chapters in the file?</li>
               				
               <li>What XPath would find  ONLY the chapters in Book 2?<br /><br /></li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         				
         				
         				
         <li>Look at the outline structure of the document to help you with
            					these: What's the XPath to identify the <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> element inside a
            					chapter <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span>? How would we locate a <span class="code">&lt;l&gt;</span> (or line) element inside a
            					chapter <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span>?<br /><br /></li>
         						
         						
         <li>Georg Forster used a lot of footnotes in his document: These are
            							coded inside <span class="code">&lt;ref&gt;</span> elements throughout the body paragraphs of the
            							text. What's the XPath to locate all the notes in the document?<br /><br /></li>
         							
         				
         <li>We've encoded lots of <span class="code">&lt;placeName&gt;</span> elements in this document to
            								mark names of places, and these may occur in lots of positions.
            								Sometimes they're in the <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> elements that start the book or
            					chapter divs, positioned inside lines of texts (coded with <span class="code">&lt;l&gt;</span>). Most
            					often they're nested in the body paragraphs (<span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>), and they're
            											frequently coded in Forsters notes, which you've just located.
            											
            											
            <ul>
               <li>What's the XPath to determine the number of placeNames that appear
                  												inside ONLY the <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> elements, and not in the rest of the document?
                  												(Notice where these are located in the heads).
               </li>
               												
               <li>What's the XPath to find the placeNames that are only mentioned in the notes?</li>
               												
               <li>What's the XPath to find the placeNames that are only mentioned in
                  												the notes of Book I? How many of these are there?<br /><br /></li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ol>
