      <p>In our course, at the point we expect you’ll be reading this, you
         						have been writing and planning XML documents. By now you’re accustomed
         						to writing well-formed XML code, as well as writing rules to constrain what
         						elements, attributes, and content you want an XML file to contain. So far,
         						your writing of code has followed <strong>syntax</strong> rules for
         						well-formedness, leaving the naming and content of your elements and
         						attributes up to you, <a href="explainRNG.html">to control with your own
            							schema rules</a>. We now turn to orient you to <strong>HTML</strong> (or
         							<strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
         							<strong>L</strong>anguage), which has its origins in the concept of
         						“hypertexts” as <strong>linkable</strong> (or
         						“hyperlinked”) documents, and developed into markup controlling
         						the presentation of pages to be networked and shared on the World Wide Web
         						(W3).
      </p>
      			
      <p>In writing HTML, we work within a standardized set of element and attribute names
         				designed to be read by web browsers. XHTML (and the other forms of HTML that
         				we’ll tell you about) all rely on standards formulated by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (abbreviated
         					<strong>W3C</strong>), an organization founded in 1994 to develop open-source,
         				platform-independent schema for coding and best practices around the world for
         				sharing and displaying in web browsers. A web browser is software designed to
         share
         				and display documents and other resources on the World Wide Web accessed through
         the
         				internet. A web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is considered
         				“standards-compliant” when it supports the coding approved by the W3C
         				for the creation of web pages, their styling, their linking to other sites, their
         				representation of metadata, and their dynamic features to be customized by site
         				visitors. Those curious to read about the history of HTML and the origins of the
         				World Wide Web (and the much earlier origins of the Internet) can read more at
         <a href="http://www.livinginternet.com/">LivingInternet.com</a> (a wonderfully
         				extensive resource), or this concise and witty walk through: <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/internet-history-html-evolution/">“Internet History: HTML Code Evolution 1.0 to 5.0.”</a></p>
      			
      <p>This guide orients you to <strong>XHTML</strong> (or e<strong>X</strong>tensible
         					<strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
         					<strong>L</strong>anguage), which at the time of this writing is the most
         				strictly defined content model for hypertexts. XHTML requires XML syntax using
         the
         				hierarchical, nested elements and the start and end tags that you are familiar
         with
         				from writing XML. XHTML is the form of HTML used by the W3C on their site
         				pages, and it has served as the long-term recommendation for precise code designed
         				to be <strong>interoperable</strong> with other XML data formats, such as SVG
         				(Scalable Vector Graphics—which you’ll later be learning to draw and code).
         					<strong>Interoperability</strong> is term referring to a technology’s
         				capacity to communicate effectively with a different kind of technology. HTML
         and
         				the World Wide Web were first developed in the early 1990s in an attempt to make
         				various information retrieval structures speak to each other in an interoperable
         				way, and XHTML, due to its strict syntax control, effectively maximizes the
         				interoperability of HTML, which is especially important for those of us developing
         				XML-based projects with a public face on the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      			
      <h3>Basic Requirements of XHTML</h3>
      			
      <p><strong>Valid XHTML 5 syntax</strong> requires the following structure,
         				beginning with a <span class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</span> declaration: 
      </p>
      		
      <div class="code"> &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br /> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br /> &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;<br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;head&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;title&gt;A Title Here&lt;/title&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/head&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;body&gt;<br /></span>
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/body&gt;</span><br /> &lt;/html&gt;<br />
         			
      </div>
      			
      <p>The <span class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</span> and namespace declarations tell the web browser what
         				version of HTML you’re working with. 
         				&lt;oXygen/&gt; inserts this declaration for us when we choose it from the
         				“Framework Template” list: To open a new XHTML file with the current doctype and
         namespace declarations, look in
         				&lt;oXygen/&gt; under <strong>File → New → Framework Templates
            					→ (scroll to XHTML in the alphabetized list) → XHTML 5.</strong>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p>You’ll recognize our root element, which is always <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> and must always indicate an XML name space as an attribute:
         				the <span class="code">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span> part. Literally,
         				this points from your root &lt;html&gt; element to the published standards set by
         				the W3 consortium for XHTML. <span class="smaller">Note: &lt;oXygen/&gt; comes with
            					up-to-date W3 schemas to validate that the code you’re writing is good,
            					strict XHTML, but if you weren’t working in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, or if
            					you’re just curious about whether a site you find on the web is valid, you
            					can always use the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation
               						Service</a>.</span>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p>The <span class="code">head</span> element is always required and must contain a
         					<span class="code">title</span> element, but note that this does not display on
         				the browser page (though it often appears in the tabs above the browser window).
         					<strong>The part of your web page that displays in the browser is coded within
            					the <span class="code">body</span> element.</strong>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p>You really don’t need many elements to build a website, so we are introducing a
         				simple selection that we find ourselves always using in our pages (including the
         				course pages you’re reading). For more, we recommend the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools site</a> as a useful ready
         				reference to look up HTML elements, see how they display in browsers, as well
         as how
         				to style them using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">Cascading
            					Stylesheets (CSS)</a> code which we’ll be covering, too, in our <a href="explainCSS.html">Introduction to CSS</a>. 
      </p>
      			
      <p>To get a view of how most of the elements we’re discussing fit together on a
         				web page, try selecting “View Page Source” (by right-clicking in your
         				browser window, or locating it in your browser menu options.
      </p>
      			
      <h3>Block-Level Body Elements</h3>
      			
      <p><strong>Block-level</strong> elements are the major structural components of an XHTML
         				page, and usually we do not nest these inside each other: They are discrete
         				“blocks” formatted for distinct display on a page. Each of these
         				elements opens on its own line and closes before the next block-level element
         opens.
         				Block-level elements are the only permitted children of the HTML root element,
         and
         				they include headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables. 
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Headings</h4>
      			
      <p>Heading elements are for title and section headings throughout your page. HTML
         				defines six levels of headings, with the idea that the first level is usually
         the
         				largest and strongest, and others get smaller and smaller. The heading tags are:
         					<span class="code">&lt;h1&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;h2&gt;</span>,
         					<span class="code">&lt;h3&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;h4&gt;</span>,
         					<span class="code">&lt;h5&gt;</span>, and <span class="code">&lt;h6&gt;</span>.
         				The idea is to use these in order, so that you typically only use <span class="code">&lt;h1&gt;</span> once to give the title of the whole page, and then use <span class="code">&lt;h2&gt;</span> for major sections and <span class="code">&lt;h3&gt;</span> for subsections (etc.) Have a look at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_headings">this
            					visual example from w3schools</a> to see how these six elements typically
         				display in a browser.
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
      			
      <p>Body paragraphs are simply coded with <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements.
         				See <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_paragraphs1">w3schools visual example</a> of code and browser display. 
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Lists</h4>
      			
      <p>Lists are made with two elements, one nested inside the other: A list needs a
         				“wrapper” (or container) element that indicates it’s a list and
         				what kind of list (and that’s the block level part): The wrapper element is
         				either &lt;ol&gt; for an “ordered” (or numbered) list, or &lt;ul&gt; for
         				an “unordered” or bulleted list. (Whether your list is numbered or
         				bulleted depends entirely on the wrapper element.) Inside that single wrapper
         we
         				have multiple “items” coded with <span class="code">&lt;li&gt;</span>
         				elements (for “list item”). Here’s a sample of coding for an
         				unordered list, followed by an example of its visual display in the browser:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;ul&gt;<br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;li&gt;apples&lt;/li&gt;<br /></span>
         				<span class="indent">&lt;li&gt;oranges&lt;/li&gt;<br /></span>
         				<span class="indent">&lt;li&gt;bananas&lt;/li&gt;<br /></span> &lt;/ul&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Here’s the browser display of the coding above:</p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li>apples</li>
         				
         <li>oranges</li>
         				
         <li>bananas</li>
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <p>If I change my wrapper element from &lt;ul&gt; to &lt;ol&gt;, I generate an ordered
         				(numbered) list: 
      </p>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li>apples</li>
         				
         <li>oranges</li>
         				
         <li>bananas</li>
         			
      </ol>
      			
      <p>(You’re probably noticing how much extra spacing I have in my unordered list:
         				That’s because I have styled my unordered lists with CSS code to be
         				“padded” with extra spaces on my course pages. Here’s <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists4">a visual
            					example from w3schools</a> so you can see a default (unstyled) browser view. Try
         				editing the code on the w3schools page to turn the unordered list into an ordered
         				list!
      </p>
      			
      <h4>Tables</h4>
      			
      <p>Tables are a little more complicated: These are made with three nested elements:</p>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li><span class="code">&lt;table&gt;</span>: This is the “wrapper”
            					block-level element on the outside that defines the table. We can place an
            					attribute called "border" on table to outline it and each of its internal cells:
            						<span class="code">&lt;table border="1"&gt;</span>
            				
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">&lt;tr&gt;</span>: Table row elements which define each
            					horizontal row of a table. 
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">&lt;td&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;th&gt;</span>:
            					Inside each table row are individual table cells (called “td” for
            					“table data”). You can designate “heading” cells, which
            					is styled with a little more emphasis, using <span class="code">&lt;th&gt;</span> (or “table header” cell).
         </li>
         			
      </ol>
      			
      <p>This may seem odd, but there isn't an element for wrapping columns in a table.
         				Instead, columns are created by stacking the individual <span class="code">td</span>
         				cells inside their <span class="code">tr</span> rows. If a table row has five cells
         				inside, you have a table with five columns.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Here is a sample of code for an HTML table, outlined with a border, and containing
         				three rows and three columns. In the first row, we've designated the table cells
         to
         				be ( <span class="code">th</span> ) for headings, followed by a couple of rows
         				containing ordinary <span class="code">td</span> cells.
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;table border="1"&gt;<br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;tr&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;th&gt;Row 1, left column (heading
            					cell)&lt;/th&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;th&gt;Row 1, middle column (heading
            					cell)&lt;/th&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;th&gt;Row 1, right column (heading
            					cell)&lt;/th&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/tr&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;tr&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 2, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 2, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 2, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/tr&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;tr&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 3, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 3, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 3, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/tr&gt;</span><br /> &lt;/table&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Here's a visual display of the table coding above:</p>
      			
      <table>
         				
         <tr>
            					
            <th>Row 1, left column (heading cell)</th>
            					
            <th>Row 1, middle column (heading cell)</th>
            					
            <th>Row 1, right column (heading cell)</th>
            				
         </tr>
         				
         <tr>
            					
            <td>Row 2, left column</td>
            					
            <td>Row 2, left column</td>
            					
            <td>Row 2, left column</td>
            				
         </tr>
         				
         <tr>
            					
            <td>Row 3, left column</td>
            					
            <td>Row 3, left column</td>
            					
            <td>Row 3, left column</td>
            				
         </tr>
         
         			
      </table>
      			
      <h3>In-line Body Elements</h3>
      			
      <p>In-line elements are used inside the block-level elements, to set apart certain
         				passages with emphasis, or to link out to other pages, or display an image or
         render
         				a multimedia file in the browser. We use the following in-line elements most
         				frequently in our work:
      </p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li><strong>Bolding:</strong> Two choices: <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span> or
            						<span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span>. One of these simply indicates
            					bold, while the other is an example of a <strong>semantic</strong> element,
            					which we like to use when we want to convey emphasis.
         </li>
         				
         <li><b><em>Italics:</em></b> Again, two choices (with similar significance): <span class="code">&lt;i&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;em&gt;</span>. The
            					semantic element here is <span class="code">&lt;em&gt;</span>, again to indicate
            					real <em>emphasis</em>. We use the <span class="code">&lt;i&gt;</span> element
            					for titles of books, movies, etc, where we would typically italicize a title,
            as
            					in Mary Shelley's novel, <i>Frankenstein</i>. The output is really the same, but
            					the underlying code can carry some meaning behind the presentational
            					display.
         </li>
         				
         <li><b>Links:</b> Use the “anchor” element <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> to wrap text to make a clickable link, and define the
            					target of the link with the <span class="code">@href</span> attribute, like this
            					(code view followed by browser display):<br /><br />
            					
            <div class="code"> &lt;p&gt;Here's some text inside a paragraph with a &lt;a
               						href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/DHDS/"&gt;clickable link to our course
               						homepage&lt;/a&gt;. And then some more text.&lt;/p&gt;
            </div>
            					
            <p>Here's some text inside a paragraph with a <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/DHDS/">clickable link to our course
                  							homepage</a>. And then some more text.
            </p>
            				
         </li>
         				
         <li><b>Images:</b>
            					<span class="code">&lt;img/&gt;</span> with its required <span class="code">@src</span> and <span class="code">@alt</span> attributes. Image elements
            					are distinct from other in-line elements because they are <strong>empty</strong>
            					(or self-closing) elements: they contain only attribute content, not textual
            					content. 
            <div class="code"> &lt;img src="sandbox.jpg" alt="image of a
               						sandbox"/&gt; 
            </div>
            					
            <p>To make an image display in your web page is a little like coding a link: You
               						have to point to a target using the <span class="code">@src</span> attribute
               						and set its value to indicate a separate image file, and you have to set the
               							<span class="code">@alt</span> attribute to some text that serves as a
               						stand-in for the image, a W3C requirement in case the image does not display
               						in the browser, as for example in braille browsers or browsers with text to
               						speech recognition for the visually impaired. The image file might be
               						sitting in the same local directory with your web page, as in the example
               						above. Or we can point to an image at some other file or address on the
               						World Wide Web, like this: 
            </p>
            					
            <div class="code"> &lt;img
               						src="wolf_and_eagle.jpg"
               						alt="Leonardo Da Vinci's drawing of the Allegory of the Wolf and the
               						Eagle"/&gt; 
            </div>
            					
            <p>Sources like Wikimedia Commons provide public domain images with information
               						on their sources, so we recommend browsing here. (Notice <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leonardo_da_vinci,_Allegory_with_wolf_and_eagle.jpg">the kinds of information Wikimedia Commons makes available</a> about
               						the Da Vinci image in our example.) 
            </p>

      <h3>Generic Block and Inline Body Elements: (div and span)</h3>
      			
      <p>You should know about two more extremely versatile HTML elements. These are used to
         				block off portions of your document to format in a precise way, such as to create
         				boxes sitting side by side on your page (as we did above to set a text next to
         an
         				image). These are extremely useful for styling with CSS, as <a href="explainCSS.html">you'll be learning shortly</a>. Here are the generic
         				elements that we frequently use:
      </p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         <li><span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span>: The div element lets you wrap a portion
            					of your page in a block-level division, perhaps to style in a particular way
            or
            					locate in a particular space on your page. We've used <span class="code">div</span> elements all over this page to organize it visually. We
            					typically use an <span class="code">@class</span> attribute to designate
            					particular kinds of divs, to designate divs that hold images, or divs that hold
            					blocks of display code, for example. Example: <span class="code">&lt;div
               						class="inner-box"&gt;</span>
            				
         </li>
         				
         <li><span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span>: The span element is our in-line generic
            					element for grabbing and highlighting significant spans of text that we want
            to
            					stand out, perhaps with color coding. We've used the <span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span> element on this page and on our other guide pages to
            					highlight the code snippets we show you in-line, and again we typically use an
            						<span class="code">@class</span> attribute to classify different kinds of
            					spans. Example: <span class="code">&lt;span class="code-snippet"&gt;</span></li>
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <h3>Editing and Uploading Your XHTML Pages: Working with Server Space</h3>
      			
      <p>You can edit XHTML pages and save them, together with their associated image and
         				stylesheet (and other) files, in a directory all together to be viewed in a web
         				browser. That directory could be on your own personal computer (and while you
         are
         				first developing pages you might simply save files on your local computer even
         				disconnected from the internet to view in a web browser while you're drafting,
         				though of course any content you have linked to on remote locations on the World
         				Wide Web will not load if you are not online). Typically we create web pages to
         have
         				a public-facing presence on the World Wide Web, or at least to have a community
         				presence on an intranet (shared within a firewall while a site is under
         				development). To make our pages available to others to access requires uploading
         				them to a web server using <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>T</strong>ransfer
         					<strong>P</strong>rotocol (FTP), a standard rule system for exchanging files
         				between computers over a network. Various security measures have been developed
         to
         				guard web servers from invasive hacking attacks, so that many web servers require
         					<strong>S</strong>ecure <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>T</strong>ransfer
         					<strong>P</strong>rotocol (SFTP) and nearly always require registration and
         				authentication with a username and password. SFTP can be accessed <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm">from command line</a>,
         				though more frequently people tend to use one of several freely available SFTP
         				software clients with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that stores your site
         				connection information and, on connection, shows the files in your computer and
         the
         				files on the remote server, making it easy to upload and download. (We've posted
         				information on <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/DHDS/Fall2014-DHSyll.html">several
            					SFTP clients </a>on our course syllabus.) When XHTML pages are uploaded on a web
         				server, they are given a specific <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>U</strong>niform
         					<strong>R</strong>esource <strong>L</strong>ocator, otherwise known as a website
         				address, and it usually begins with <strong>http://</strong> followed by a a
         				distinct locator for the web browser and your files on it, as in
         					<strong>http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/DHDS/Fall2014-DHSyll.html</strong>. 
      </p>
      			
      <p>By convention, the first page you place in a particular website folder is designated
         				your <strong>index.html</strong> page. You don't have to have an index.html, but if
         				you do, the main page of your site can be abbreviated to the name of the site
         				directory holding the web files, like this one for my personal Pitt homepage:
         						<strong><a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/">http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/</a></strong> . By default, when given that address,
         				the web browser retrieves the index.html file I have placed in that space, and
         if it
         				doesn't find one it generates an error. (The site address leads to exactly the
         same
         				place as <strong>http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/index.html</strong> .)
      </p>
      			
      <p>If you are a student enrolled in our course at Pitt-Greensburg, we have shown you
         (or
         				are about to show you) how to access our class’s Sandbox server space with our
         					<a href="SremoteSandboxInstruct.pdf">sremote (firewall) service</a> together
         				with <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">SFTP (instructions posted on Courseweb
            					Announcements)</a> so that you can access your personal folder to upload files
         				through an SFTP client and then view those files in a web browser. As with most
         				colleges and universities, students, faculty, and staff across the Pitt system
         have
         				access to public-facing personal web space, which we encourage you to learn about
         				and set up on your space following <a href="http://technology.pitt.edu/Documents/network/web-sites/afs_web.pdf">Pitt's
            					posted instructions</a>. Enrolled students in our course will use our intranet
         				Sandbox server space for XHTML related homework exercises and project website
         				development.
