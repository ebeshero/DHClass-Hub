      <p>Our second XQuery homework exercise works with our Digital Mitford project files,
         coded in TEI. Here’s how to locate this collection in eXist on our Greensburg DH/DS
         Sandbox server: <span class="code">collection('/db/mitford')</span>.
      </p>
      				
      			
      		
      <p>IMPORTANT: You’ll need to <b>declare the TEI namespace </b>at the top of any XQuery you run (in the line just under "xquery version "3.0";).
         Here’s the line you need for that:
      </p>
      
      <div class="code">declare default element namespace "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";</div>
      			
      <!--<p>Here's <b><a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/t1iph7pf0vwbn3s2bn7r">a model (text file saved in our Box XQuery collection)</a></b> on how to do a very similar task with the Shakespeare collection, the one we walked through in class on Mon. Oct. 21. (Remember, this wasn't a TEI file, and our TEI files have a different structure-\-you'll want to look at their file structure to see how to find your way to their main title element.)</p>-->
      
      <p>Write XQuery expressions for each of the following tasks. Paste these into a text
         file or a document, and upload your assignment to Courseweb.
      </p>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li>First, let’s do some exploring. This is a large collection of files, so we might want
            to look at a complete list of their file names and get a count of the number of files.
            For this, we use the XPath function <span class="code">base-uri()</span>. Write a statement in XQuery that returns the base-uri() (or filename) for each file
            in the Mitford collection. How many files are there? Wrap the expression in a count()
            function so you return the number, and record the expression you used.
         </li>
         				
         				
         <li> Starting from the collection(), write a basic XQuery expression to show you the coding
            of the files, using <span class="code">/*</span>, so that you can see how to locate the <span class="code">&lt;title&gt;</span> element inside the <span class="code">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;titleStmt&gt;</span>. Copy this into your text file recording this homework exercise.
            			
         </li>
         			
         <li>
            			Begin working on FLWOR expressions. First, write a very simple FLWOR statement
            to define variables that will return the following:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>the whole collection</li>
               
               <li>the particular texts in the collection, starting from the <span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span> element in our TEI files. (You'll need this later.)
               </li>
               
               <li>the main title of the files (as described in #2: up in the TEI header, inside the
                  titleStmt).
                  
               </li>
               
               
            </ul>
            Write a return statement to return the text ONLY of the main titles of the files in
            this collection. Refer to our past homework exercise...data() or string() or text().
            **Copy this into a text file recording this homework exercise.**   
            
         </li>
         				
         <li>Build on your FLWOR expression. We are looking for some very important personal contacts
            of Mitford whose names turn up in the <span class="code">//body</span> of <strong>more than 15 files</strong> in the Digital Mitford collection. Note: 
            <ul>
               					
               <li>We don't want results from the TEI Header because that would include the current Mitford
                  editors, so we want to define our variable with an XPath that drills into the <span class="code">body</span> element of each file.
               </li> 
               <li>Each person is coded with a distinct identifier held in an @ref attribute: <span class="code">&lt;persName ref="#id"&gt;</span>, which helps us to keep track of people when they are referred to by different names
                  in the archive.
               </li> 
               <li>Define a variable to collect a list of the distinct values of this <span class="code">@ref</span> attribute. <strong>Note:</strong> To get output in XQuery when you collect a list of attribute values, you need to
                  return the <span class="code">string()</span> value of the attribute.
               </li>
               <li>Then we'll need to test each entry in that list (<span class="code">$i</span>) to see if it can be found by an XPath walking through all the files in the collection,
                  building a predicate expression to filter the files to see if they contain our match.
                  (You are looking to see if a file contains a <span class="code">persName @ref</span> that matches each single entry in that list of distinct values.) 
               </li>
               				
               <li>Use the <span class="code">where</span> statement in the FLWOR to filter your results so that you return only the distinct
                  @ref attributes that are seen in more than 15 files. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>We'd like to return the output without the hashtag (<strong>#</strong>) in front, and we want to output the results in alphabetical order by the @ref (without
                  hashtag). To eliminate the hashtag, we recommend the <span class="code">translate()</span> function (read about it in Michael Kay or look it up in <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/functions.html">The XPath Functions We Use the Most</a>. (You may remember that we've used it before in our XSLT exercises.)
               </li>
               					
               <li>Reading our <a href="explainXQuery.html">Explain XQuery Guide</a> to look up the details, write the FLOWR statement to <span class="code">order</span> results alphabetically.
               </li>
               					
               <li>Add the appropriate word to the "order" statement to generate these results in reverse
                  order. (Refer to our guide linked here.)
               </li>
               				
            </ul>
            			 
            			 
            			  
         </li>
         			
         <li> Now, build an html file around your XQuery results using curly braces <strong>{ }</strong> where necessary. Consult our <b><a href="explainXQuery.html#Curly">XQuery Intro Guide on building HTML with Curly Braces</a>.</b></li>
         				
         <li>Build an HTML table in the HTML body part of the file to contain table rows and a
            two columns of cells (two cells side by side in each column) that will contain in
            one cell the translated and sorted @ref (without hashtag). You'll need to write a
            new XQuery line or two to generate the results in the cell next to it. In that cell,
            return a string-joined list of the <span class="code">base-uri()</span> or filenames of each file that contains the match, separated by commas.
            			  
         </li>
         				
         <li><strong>Bonus</strong>: If you don't like the look of that string-joined output in your second table cell,
            can you work out how to output it in its own table, nested inside the table cell?
            Inside the table cell, you will need to nest a new FLWOR statement inside a new set
            of curly braces, in which you'll make another <span class="code">for</span> statement. Return your output in table rows with a single column of cells.
         </li>
