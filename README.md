DHClass-Hub
===========

Welcome to the Pitt-Greensburg DH Class Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/">http://newtfire.org/dh/</a>.

* Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer. 
* Read and follow the instructions here to get started with GitHub: <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/github.xhtml">http://dh.obdurodon.org/github.xhtml</a>

* In order for you to participate in this shared class space, to add files, open issues, and join the discussions here, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and write to me to tell me how to find you. 

* We recommend installing a free desktop client for convenient use of GitHub as a repository to manage shared class and project files: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a>. The desktop client helps you with synchronizing local Github directories on your computer(s) with the central repository in the GitHub cloud.

* When you have set up an account and have a desktop client to work with, you are ready to experiment with pushing (or committing) new files to this repository. Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space. To do this, first <strong>commit</strong> your changes and write the required commit message. Then you must <strong>sync</strong> in order to push these to the GitHub cloud. 

* **Always be sure to "sync"** your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. Always sync your local directory with our cloud directory here on the web **when you begin work**, and **when you conclude work** at a local computer.

* Now, there are things we'll do together **only in the webpage view of GitHub:** See if you can find the "Issues" and "Wiki" areas (mousing over the icons on the right-hand side of the GitHub page): "Issues" is the exclamation point inside the circle, and the "Wiki" pages will be under the icon for a book. We're using the "Issues" page to open conversations about questions, problems, things we need to discuss and fix and work on together. If we formulate a new method or policy we definitely want to follow, we'll post a Wiki page about it. The Issues and Wikis are searchable, and you write in them using "markdown," which lets you easily and quickly format headings, lists, bold, italics, or share an image, etc.
