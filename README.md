DHClass-Hub
===========

Welcome to the DH Class Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/">http://newtfire.org/dh/</a>.

* In order for you to participate fully in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and write to me to tell me how to find you. 

* Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer. 
* Read and follow the instructions here to get started with Git: <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/explainGitShell.html">http://newtfire.org/dh/explainGitShell.html</a>

* When you have set up an account and have installed the Git Bash shell locally on your computer, you are ready to experiment with pushing (or committing) new files to this repository. Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space. To do this, first <strong>commit</strong> your changes and write the required commit message. Then you must <strong>push</strong> in order to sync these changes to the GitHub cloud. 

* **Always be sure to "sync"** your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. At command line, that means, issue a **"git pull"** (or a **"git fetch"** and **"git merge"**) command to retrieve changes to the directories from the cloud before you begin working. Always sync your local directory with our cloud directory here on the web **when you begin work**, and **when you conclude work** at a local computer.

* There are things we'll do together **only in the webpage view of GitHub:** See if you can find the "Issues" and "Wiki" areas by mousing over the icons on the top (in the new view) or the right-hand (old view) side of the GitHub page: "Issues" is the exclamation point inside the circle, and the "Wiki" pages will be under the icon for a book. We're using the "Issues" page to open conversations about questions, problems, things we need to discuss and fix and work on together. If we formulate a new method or policy we definitely want to follow, we'll post a Wiki page about it. The Issues and Wikis are searchable, and you write in them using [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which lets you easily and quickly format headings, lists, bold, italics, or share an image, etc.
