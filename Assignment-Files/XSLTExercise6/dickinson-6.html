         <p>
            1: I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br />
            2: And Mourners to and fro <br />
            3: Kept treading—treading—till it seemed <br />

            6: A Service, like a Drum— <br />
            7: Kept beating—beating—till I thought <br />
            8: My Mind was going numb— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            9: And then I heard them lift a Box <br />
            10: And creak across my Soul <br />
            11: With those same Boots of lead, again, <br />
            12: Then Space began to toll, 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            13: As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br />
            14: And Being, but an Ear, <br />
            15: And I, and Silence, some strange Race <br />

         </p>
         <p>
            17: And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br />
            18: And I dropped down, and down— <br />
            19: And hit a World, at every

            1: 'Tis so appalling—it exhilarates— <br />
            2: 
            
            <span class="var0">So over Horror, it half Captivates—</span>

            5: To scan a Ghost, is faint— <br />

         </p>
         <p>
            9: The Truth, is Bald, and Cold— <br />
            10: But that will hold— <br />
            11: If any are not sure— <br />
            12: We show them—prayer— <br />
            13: But we, who know, <br />
            14: Stop hoping, now— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            15: Looking at Death, is Dying— <br />
            16: Just let go the Breath— <br />
            17: And not the pillow at your Cheek <br />

            20: Yours, is done— <br />
            21: And so of Woe, bleak dreaded—come, <br />
            22: It sets the Fright at liberty— <br />
