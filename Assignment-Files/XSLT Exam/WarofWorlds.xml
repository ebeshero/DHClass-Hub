        star of these broadcasts, Orson Welles . . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ORSON WELLES:</spkr> We know now that in the early years of the twentieth century
        this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal
        as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns
        they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope
        might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With
        infinite complacence people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs,
        serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar
        driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and
        Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that to our minds as ours are to the
        beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with
        envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the thirty-ninth year of
        the twentieth century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October.
        Business was better. The war scare was over. More men were back at work. Sales were picking
        up. On this particular evening, October 30, the Crossley service estimated that thirty-two
        million people were listening in on radios. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER:</spkr> . . .for the next twenty-four hours not much change in temperature.
        A slight atmospheric disturbance of undetermined origin is reported over Nova Scotia,
        causing a low pressure area to move down rather rapidly over the northeastern states,
        bringing a forecast of rain, accompanied by winds of light gale force. Maximum temperature
        66; minimum 48. This weather report comes to you from the Government Weather Bureau. . . .
        We now take you to the Meridian Room in the Hotel Park Plaza in downtown New York, where you
        will be entertained by the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra. <stage>MUSIC: SPANISH

    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER TWO:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of dance music
        to bring you a special bulletin from the Intercontinental Radio News. At twenty minutes
        before eight, central time, Professor Farrell of the Mount Jennings Observatory, Chicago,
        Illinois, reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas, occurring at regular
        intervals on the planet Mars. The spectroscope indicates the gas to be hydrogen and moving
        towards the earth with enormous velocity. Professor Pierson of the Observatory at Princeton
        confirms Farrell's observation, and describes the phenomenon as <stage>quote) like a jet of
            blue flame shot from a gun (unquote</stage>. We now return you to the music of Ramon

    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER TWO:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, following on the news given in our
        bulletin a moment ago, the Government Meteorological Bureau has requested the large
        observatories of the country to keep an astronomical watch on any further disturbances
        occurring on the planet Mars. Due to the unusual nature of this occurance, we have arranged
        an interview with noted astronomer. Professor Pierson, who will give us his views on the
        event. in a few moments we will take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton, New
        Jersey. We return you until then to the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra. <stage>MUSIC

    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER TWO:</spkr> We are now ready to take you to the Princeton Observatory at
        Princeton where Carl Phillips, or commentator, will interview Professor Richard Pierson,
        famous astronomer. We take you now to Princeton, New Jersey. <stage>ECHO CHAMBER. FX: TICK-TOCK
            SOUND</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Carl Phillips, speaking
        to you from the observatory at Princeton. I am standing in a large semi-circular room, pitch
        black except for an oblong split in the ceiling. Through this opening i can see a sprinkling
        of stars that cast a kind of frosty glow over the intricate mechanism of the huge telescope.
        The ticking sound you hear is the vibration of the clockwork. Professor Pierson stands
        directly above me on a small platform, peering through a giant lens. I ask you to be
        patient, ladies and gentlemen, during any delay that may arise during our interview. Besides
        his ceaseless watch of the heavens, Professor Pierson may be interrupted by telephone or
        other communications. During this period he is in constant touch with the astronomical
        centers of the world . . . Professor, may I begin our questions? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> At any time, Mr. Phillips. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Professor, would you please tell our radio audience exactly what you
        see as you observe the planet Mars through your telescope? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Nothing unusual at the moment, Mr. Phillips. A red disk swimming in a
        blue sea. Transverse stripes across the disk. Quite distinct now because Mars happens to be
        the point nearest the earth . . . in opposition, as we call it. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> In your opinion, what do these transverse stripes signify, Professor
        Pierson? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Not canals, I can assure you, Mr. Phillips, although that's the
        popular conjecture of those who imagine Mars to be inhabited. From a scientific viewpoint
        the stripes are merely the result of atmospheric conditions peculiar to the planet. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Then you're quite convinced as a scientist that living intelligence
        as we know it does not exist on Mars? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> I'd say the chances against it are a thousand to one. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> And yet how do you account for those gas eruptions occurring on the
        surface of the planet at regular intervals? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Mr. Phillips, I cannot account for it. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> By the way, Professor, for the benefit of our listeners, how far is
        Mars from earth? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Approximately forty million miles. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Well, that seems a safe enough distance. <stage>OFF MIKE</stage> Thank
        you. <stage>PAUSE</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, someone has just handed
        Professor Pierson a message. While he reads it, let me remind you that we are speaking to
        you from the observatory in Princeton, New Jersey, where we are interviewing the world-
        famous astronomer, Professor Pierson . . . One moment, please. Professor Pierson has passed
        me a message which he has just received . . . Professor, may I read the message to the
        listening audience? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Certainly, Mr. Phillips </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, I shall read you a wire addressed to Professor
        Pierson from Dr. Gray of the National History Museum, New York. "9: 15 P.M. eastern standard
        time. Seismograph registered shock of almost earthquake intensity occurring within a radius
        of twenty miles of Princeton. Please investigate. Signed, Lloyd Gray, Chief of Astronomical
        Division" . . . Professor Pierson, could this occurrence possibly have something to do with
        the disturbances observed on the planet Mars? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Hardly, Mr. Phillips. This is probably a meteorite of unusual size
        and its arrival at this particular time is merely a coincidence. However, we shall conduct a
        search, as soon as daylight permits. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Thank you, Professor. Ladies and gentlemen, for the past ten minutes
        we've been speaking to you from the observatory at Princeton, bringing you a special
        interview with Professor Pierson, noted astronomer. This is Carl Phillips speaking. We are
        returning you now to our New York studio. <stage>FADE IN PIANO PLAYING</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER TWO:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, here is the latest bulletin from the
        Intercontinental Radio News. Toronto, Canada: Professor Morse of McGill University reports
        observing a total of three explosions on the planet Mars, between the hours of 7: 45 P.M.
        and 9: 20 P.M., eastern standard time. This confirms earlier reports received from American
        observatories. Now, nearer home, comes a special announcement from Trenton, New Jersey. It
        is reported that at 8: 50 P.M. a huge, flaming object, believed to be a meteorite, fell on a
        farm in the neighborhood of Grovers Mill, New Jersey, twenty-two miles from Trenton. The
        flash in the sky was visible within a radius of several hundred miles and the noise of the
        impact was heard as far north as Elizabeth. We have dispatched a special mobile unit to the
        scene, and will have our commentator, Carl Phillips, give you a word description as soon as
        he can reach there from Princeton. In the meantime, we take you to the Hotel Martinet in
        Brooklyn, where Bobby Millette and his orchestra are offering a program of dance music.

    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, this is Carl Phillips again, at the Wilmuth
        farm, Grovers Mill, New Jersey. Professor Pierson and myself made the eleven miles from
        Princeton in ten minutes. Well, I . . . I hardly know where to begin, to paint for you a
        word picture of the strange scene before my eyes, like something out of a modern "Arabian
        Nights." Well, I just got here. I haven't had a chance to look around yet. I guess that's
        it. Yes, I guess that's the . . . thing, directly in front of me, half buried in a vast pit.
        Must have struck with terrific force. The ground is covered with splinters of a tree it must
        have struck on its way down. What I can see of the . . . object itself doesn't look very
        much like a meteor, at least not the meteors I've seen. It looks more like a huge cylinder.
        It has a diameter of . . . what would you say, Professor Pierson? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr><stage>OFF-MIKE</stage> What's that? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> What would you say . . . what is the diameter? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> About thirty yards. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> About thirty yards . . . The metal on the sheath is . . . well, I've
        never seen anything like it. The color is sort of yellowish-white. Curious spectators now
        are pressing close to the object in spite of the efforts of the police to keep them back.
        They're getting in front of my line of vision. Would you mind standing to one side, please? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>POLICEMAN:</spkr> One side, there, one side. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> While the policemen are pushing the crowd back, here's Mr. Wilmuth,
        owner of the farm here. He may have some interesting facts to add . . . Mr. Wilmuth, would
        you please tell the radio audience as much as you remember of this rather unusual visitor
        that dropped in your backyard? Step closer, please. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr.
        Wilmuth. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> Well, I was listenin' to the radio. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Closer and louder please. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> Pardon me?! </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Louder, please, and closer. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> Yes, sir -- I was listening to the radio and kinda drowsin'. That
        Professor fellow was talkin' about Mars, so I was half dozin' and half . . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Yes, yes, Mr. Wilmuth. Then what happened? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> As I was sayin', I was listenin' to the radio kinda halfways . . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Yes, Mr. Wilmuth, and then you saw something? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> Not first off. I heard something. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> And what did you hear? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> A hissing sound. Like this: SSSSSSS . . . kinda like a fourt' of July
        rocket. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Yes, then what? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> Turned my head out the window and would have swore I was to sleep and
        dreamin.' </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Then what? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> I seen a kinda greenish streak and then zingo! Somethin' smacked the
        ground. Knocked me clear out of my chair! </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Well, were you frightened, Mr. Wilmuth? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> Well, I -- I ain't quite sure. I reckon I -- I was kinda riled. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Thank you, Mr. Wilmuth. Thank you. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>WILMUTH:</spkr> Want me to tell you some more? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> No . . . That's quite all right, that's plenty. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, you've just heard Mr. Wilmuth, owner of the
        farm where this thing has fallen. I wish I could convey the atmosphere . . . the background
        of this . . . fantastic scene. Hundreds of cars are parked in a field in back of us. Police
        are trying to rope off the roadway leading to the farm. But it's no use. They're breaking
        right through. Cars' headlights throw an enormous spot on the pit where the object's half
        buried. Some of the more daring souls are now venturing near the edge. Their silhouettes
        stand out against the metal sheen. <stage>FAINT HUMMING SOUND</stage> One man wants to touch the
        thing . . . he's having an argument with a policeman. The policeman wins. . . . Now, ladies
        and gentlemen, there's something I haven't mentioned in all this excitement, but now it's
        becoming more distinct. Perhaps you've caught it already on your radio. Listen: <stage>LONG
            PAUSE</stage> . . . Do you hear it? It's a curious humming sound that seems to come from
        inside the object. I'll move the microphone nearer. <stage>PAUSE</stage> Now we're not more then
        twenty-five feet away. Can you hear it now? Oh, Professor Pierson! </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Yes, Mr. Phillips? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Can you tell us the meaning of that scraping noise inside the thing? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Possibly the unequal cooling of its surface. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> I see, do you still think it's a meteor, Professor? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> I don't know what to think. The metal casing is definitely
        extraterrestrial . . . not found on this earth. Friction with the earth's atmosphere usually
        tears holes in a meteorite. This thing is smooth and, as you can see, of cylindrical shape. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Just a minute! Something's happening! Ladies and gentlemen, this is
        terrific! This end of the thing is beginning to flake off! The top is beginning to rotate
        like a screw! The thing must be hollow! </sp>
    <sp><spkr>VOICES:</spkr> She's movin'! Look, the darn thing's unscrewing! Keep back, there!
        Keep back, I tell you! Maybe there's men in it trying to escape! It's red hot, they'll burn
        to a cinder! Keep back there. Keep those idiots back! <stage>SUDDENLY THE CLANKING SOUND OF A
            HUGE PIECE OF FALLING METAL</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>VOICES:</spkr> She's off! The top's loose! Look out there! Stand back! </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most terrifying thing I have ever
        witnessed . . . Wait a minute! Someone's crawling out of the hollow top. Someone or . . .
        something. I can see peering out of that black hole two luminous disks . . are they eyes? It
        might be a face. It might be . . . <stage>SHOUT OF AWE FROM THE CROWD</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Good heavens, something's wriggling out of the shadow like a gray
        snake. Now it's another one, and another. They look like tentacles to me. There, I can see
        the thing's body. It's large, large as a bear and it glistens like wet leather. But that
        face, it . . . Ladies and gentlemen, it's indescribable. I can hardly force myself to keep
        looking at it. The eyes are black and gleam like a serpent. The mouth is V-shaped with
        saliva dripping from its rimless lips that seem to quiver and pulsate. The monster or
        whatever it is can hardly move. It seems weighed down by . . . possibly gravity or
        something. The thing's raising up. The crowd falls back now. They've seen plenty. This is
        the most extraordinary experience. I can't find words . . . I'll pull this microphone with
        me as I talk. I'll have to stop the description until I can take a new position. Hold on,
        will you please, I'll be right back in a minute. <stage>FADE INTO PIANO</stage>

    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen <stage>Am I on?</stage>. Ladies and gentlemen, here I
        am, back of a stone wall that adjoins Mr. Wilmuth's garden. From here I get a sweep of the
        whole scene. I'll give you every detail as long as I can talk. As long as I can see. More
        state police have arrived They're drawing up a cordon in front of the pit, about thirty of
        them. No need to push the crowd back now. They're willing to keep their distance. The
        captain is conferring with someone. We can't quite see who. Oh yes, I believe it's Professor
        Pierson. Yes, it is. Now they've parted. The Professor moves around one side, studying the
        object, while the captain and two policemen advance with something in their hands. I can see
        it now. It's a white handkerchief tied to a pole . . . a flag of truce. If those creatures
        know what that means . . . what anything means!. . . Wait! Something's happening!

    <sp><spkr>PHILLIPS:</spkr> A humped shape is rising out of the pit. I can make out a small beam
        of light against a mirror. What's that? There's a jet of flame springing from the mirror,
        and it leaps right at the advancing men. It strikes them head on! Good Lord, they're turning
        into flame! <stage>SCREAMS AND UNEARTHLY SHRIEKS</stage>

    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we
        are unable to continue the broadcast from Grovers Mill. Evidently there's some difficulty
        with our field transmission. However, we will return to that point at the earliest
        opportunity. In the meantime, we have a late bulletin from San Diego, California. Professor
        Indellkoffer, speaking at a dinner of the California Astronomical Society, expressed the
        opinion that the explosions on Mars are undoubtedly nothing more than severe volcanic
        disturbances on the surface of the planet. We now continue with our piano interlude.

    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER TWO:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been handed a message that
        came in from Grovers Mill by telephone. Just a moment. At least forty people, including six
        state troopers lie dead in a field east of the village of Grovers Mill, their bodies burned
        and distorted beyond all possible recognition. The next voice you hear will be that of
        Brigadier General Montgomery Smith, commander of the state militia at Trenton, New Jersey. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>SMITH:</spkr> I have been requested by the governor of New Jersey to place the
        counties of Mercer and Middlesex as far west as Princeton, and east to Jamesburg, under
        martial law. No one will be permitted to enter this area except by special pass issued by
        state or military authorities. Four companies of state militia are proceeding from Trenton
        to Grovers Mill, and will aid in the evacuation of homes within the range of military
        operations. Thank you. ANNOUNCER TWO You have just been listening to General Montgomery
        Smith commanding the state militia at Trenton. In the meantime, further details of the
        catastrophe at Grovers Mill are coming in. The strange creatures after unleashing their
        deadly assault, crawled back into their pit and made no attempt to prevent the efforts of
        the firemen to recover the bodies and extinguish the fire. Combined fire departments of
        Mercer County are fighting the flames which menace the entire countryside. We have been
        unable to establish any contact with our mobile unit at Grovers Mill, but we hope to be able
        to return you there at the earliest possible moment. In the meantime we take you -- just one
        moment please. <stage>LONG PAUSE</stage>
        <stage>WHISPER</stage> Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been informed that we have finally
        established communication with an eyewitness of the tragedy. Professor Pierson has been
        located at a farmhouse near Grovers Mill where he has established an emergency observation
        post. As a scientist, he will give you his explanation of the calamity. The next voice you
        hear will be that of Professor Pierson, brought to you by direct wire. Professor Pierson.

    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Of the creatures in the rocket cylinder at Grovers Mill, I can give
        you no authoritative information -- either as to their nature, their origin, or their
        purposes here on earth Of their destructive instrument I might venture some conjectural
        explanation. For want of a better term, I shall refer to the mysterious weapon as a heat
        ray. It's all too evident that these creatures have scientific knowledge far in advance of
        our own. It is my guess that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a
        chamber of practically absolute nonconductivity. This intense heat they project in a
        parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of
        unknown composition, much as the mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light. That is my
        conjecture of the origin of the heat ray . . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER TWO:</spkr> Thank you, Professor Pierson. Ladies and gentlemen, here is a
        bulletin from Trenton. It is a brief statement informing us that the charred body of Carl
        Phillips has been identified in a Trenton hospital. Now here's another bulletin from
        Washington, D.C. Office of the director of the National Red Cross reports ten units of Red
        Cross emergency workers have been assigned to the headquarters of the state militia
        stationed outside Grovers Mill, New Jersey. Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton
        Junction: The fires at Grovers Mill and vicinity are now under control. Scouts report all
        quiet in the pit, and no sign of life appearing from the mouth of the cylinder . . . And
        now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a special statement from Mr. Harry McDonald, vice-
        president in charge of operations. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>MC DONALD:</spkr> We have received a request from the militia at Trenton to place at
        their disposal our entire broadcasting facilities. In view of the gravity of the situation,
        and believing that radio has a responsibility to serve in the public interest at all times,
        we are turning over our facilities to the state militia at Trenton. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER TWO:</spkr> We take you now to the field headquarters of the state militia
        near Grovers Mill, New Jersey. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>CAPTAIN:</spkr> This is Captain Lansing of the signal corps, attached to the state
        militia now engaged in military operations in the vicinity of Grovers Mill. Situation
        arising from the reported presence of certain individuals of unidentified nature is now
        under complete control. The cylindrical object which lies in a pit directly below our
        position is surrounded on all sides by eight battalions of infantry. Without heavy field
        pieces, but adequately armed with rifles and machine guns. All cause for alarm, if such
        cause ever existed, is now entirely unjustified. The things, whatever they are, do not even
        venture to poke their heads above the pit. I can see their hiding place plainly in the glare
        of the searchlights here. With all their reported resources, these creatures can scarcely
        stand up against heavy machine-gun fire Anyway, it's an interesting outing for the troops. I
        can make out their khaki uniforms, crossing back and forth in front of the lights. It looks
        almost like a real war. There appears to be some slight smoke in the woods bordering the
        Millstone River. Probably fire started by campers. Well, we ought to see some action soon.
        One of the companies is deploying on the left flank. An quick thrust and it will all be
        over. Now wait a minute! I see something on top of the cylinder. No, it's nothing but a
        shadow. Now the troops are on the edge of the Wilmuth farm. Seven thousand armed men closing
        in on an old metal tube. Wait, that wasn't a shadow! It's something moving . . . solid metal
        . . . kind of shield-like affair rising up out of the cylinder . . . It's going higher and
        higher. Why, it's standing on legs . . . actually rearing up on a sort of metal framework.
        Now it's reaching above the trees and the searchlights are on it. Hold on! </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER:</spkr> Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make.
        Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes
        lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey
        farmlands tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars. The battle
        which took place tonight at Grovers Mill has ended in one of the most startling defeats ever
        suffered by any army in modern times; seven thousand men armed with rifles and machine guns
        pitted against a single fighting machine of the invaders from Mars. One hundred and twenty
        known survivors. The rest strewn over the battle area from Grovers Mill to Plainsboro,
        crushed and trampled to death under the metal feet of the monster, or burned to cinders by
        its heat ray. The monster is now in control of the middle section of New Jersey and has
        effectively cut the state through its center. Communication lines are down from Pennsylvania
        to the Atlantic Ocean. Railroad tracks are torn and service from New York to Philadelphia
        discontinued except routing some of the trains through Allentown and Phoenixville. Highways
        to the north, south, and west are clogged with frantic human traffic. Police and army
        reserves are unable to control the mad flight. By morning the fugitives will have swelled
        Philadelphia, Camden, and Trenton, it is estimated, to twice their normal population. At
        this time martial law prevails throughout New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. We take you
        now to Washington for a special broadcast on the National Emergency . . . the Secretary of
        the Interior . . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>SECRETARY:</spkr> Citizens of the nation: I shall not try to conceal the gravity of
        the situation that confronts the country, nor the concern of your government in protecting
        the lives and property of its people. However, I wish to impress upon you -- private
        citizens and public officials, all of you -- the urgent need of calm and resourceful action.
        Fortunately, this formidable enemy is still confined to a comparatively small area, and we
        may place our faith in the military forces to keep them there. In the meantime placing our
        faith in God we must continue the performance of our duties each and every one of us, so
        that we may confront this destructive adversary with a nation united, courageous, and
        consecrated to the preservation of human supremacy on this earth. I thank you. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ANNOUNCER:</spkr> You have just heard the secretary of the Interior speaking from
        Washington. Bulletins too numerous to read are piling up in the studio here. We are informed
        the central portion of New Jersey is blacked out from radio communication due to the effect
        of the heat ray upon power lines and electrical equipment. Here is a special bulletin from
        New York. Cables received from English, French, German scientific bodies offering
        assistance. Astronomers report continued gas outbursts at regular intervals on planet Mars.
        Majority voice opinion that enemy will be reinforced by additional rocket machines. Attempts
        made to locate Professor Pierson of Princeton, who has observed Martians at close range. It
        is feared he was lost in recent battle. Langham field, Virginia: Scouting planes report
        three Martian machines visible above treetops, moving north towards Somerville with
        population fleeing ahead of them. Heat ray not in use; although advancing at express-train
        speed, invaders pick their way carefully. They seem to be making conscious effort to avoid
        destruction of cities and countryside. However, they stop to uproot power lines, bridges,
        and railroad tracks. Their apparent objective is to crush resistance, paralyze
        communication, and disorganize human society. Here is a bulletin from Basking Ridge, New
        Jersey: Coon hunters have stumbled on a second cylinder similar to the first embedded in the
        great swamp twenty miles south of Morristown. Army field pieces are proceeding from Newark
        to blow up second invading unit before cylinder can be opened and the fighting machine
        rigged. They are taking up position in the -- foothills of Watchung Mountains. Another
        bulletin from Langham Field, Virginia: Scouting planes report enemy machines, now three in
        number, increasing speed northward kicking over houses and trees in their evident haste to
        form a conjunction with their allies south of Morristown. Machines also sighted by telephone
        operator east of Middlesex within ten miles of Plainfield. Here's a bulletin from Winston
        Field, Long Island: Fleet of army bombers carrying heavy explosives flying north in pursuit
        of enemy. Scouting planes act as guides. They keep speeding enemy in sight. Just a moment
        please. Ladies and gentlemen, we've run special wires to the artillery line in adjacent
        villages to give you direct reports in the zone of the advancing enemy. First we take you to
        the battery of the 22nd Field Artillery, located in the Watchtung Mountains. </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> As I set down these notes on paper, I'm obsessed by the thought that
        I may be the last living man on earth. I have been hiding in this empty house near Grovers
        Mill -- a small island of daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the world.
        All that happened before the arrival of these monstrous creatures in the world now seems
        part of another life. . . a life that has no continuity with the present, furtive existence
        of the lonely derelict who pencils these words on the back of some astronomical notes
        bearing the signature of Richard Pierson. I look down at my blackened hands, my torn shoes,
        my tattered clothes, and I try to connect them with a professor who lives at Princeton, and
        who on the night of October 30, glimpsed through his telescope an orange splash of light on
        a distant planet. My wife, my colleagues, my students, my books, my observatory, my. . . my
        world. . . where are they? Did they ever exist? Am I Richard Pierson? What day is it? Do
        days exist without calendars? Does time pass when there are no human hands left to wind the
        clocks? . . .In writing down my daily life I tell myself I shall preserve human history
        between the dark covers of this little book that was meant to record the movements of the
        stars. . . But to write I must live, and to live, I must eat . . . I find moldy bread in the
        kitchen, and an orange not too spoiled to swallow. I keep watch at the window. From time to
        time I catch sight of a Martian above the black smoke. The smoke still holds the house in
        its black coil. . . but at length there is a hissing sound and suddenly I see a Martian
        mounted on his machine, spraying the air with a jet of steam, as if to dissipate the smoke.
        I watch in a corner as his huge metal legs nearly brush against the house. Exhausted by
        terror, I fall asleep. . .it's morning. . . <stage>QUIETLY</stage> Morning! Sun streams in the
        window. The black cloud of gas has lifted, and the scorched meadows to the north look as
        though a black snowstorm has passed over them. I venture from the house. I make my way to a
        road. No traffic. Here and there a wrecked car, baggage overturned, a blackened skeleton. I
        push on north. For some reason I feel safer trailing these monsters than running away from
        them. And I keep a careful watch. I have seen the Martians. . . feed. Should one of their
        machines appear over the top of trees, I am ready to fling myself flat on the earth. I come
        to a chestnut tree. October chestnuts are ripe. I fill my pockets. I must keep alive. Two
        days I wander in a vague northerly direction through a desolate world. Finally I notice a
        living creature. . . a small red squirrel in a beech tree. I stare at him, and wonder. He
        stares back at me. I believe at that moment the animal and I shared the same emotion. . .the
        joy of finding another living being. I push on north. I find dead cows in a brackish field.
        Beyond, the charred ruins of a dairy. The silo remains standing guard over the waste land
        like a lighthouse deserted by the sea. Astride the silo perches a weathercock. The arrow
        points north. Next day I came to a city vaguely familiar in its contours, yet its buildings
        strangely dwarfed and leveled off, as if a giant hand sliced off its highest towers with a
        capricious sweep of his hand. I reached the outskirts. I found Newark, undemolished, but
        humbled by some whim of the advancing Martians. Presently, with an odd feeling of being
        watched, I caught sight of something crouching in a doorway. I made a step towards it, and
        it rose up and bacame a man! -- a man, armed with a large knife. </sp>

        Five days ago a couple of them carried somethin' big across the flats from the airport. I

        enough to keep quiet. . . botherin' them with guns and such stuff and losing our heads and
        rushing off in crowds. Now instead of our rushing around blind we've got to fix ourselves up
        -- fix ourselves up according to the way things are NOW. Cities, nations, civilization,
        progress. . . done. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> But if that's so, what is there to live for? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> Well, there won't be any more concerts for a million years or so,
        and no nice little dinners at restaurants. If it's amusement you're after, I guess the
        game's up. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> And what is there left? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> Life. . . that's what! I want to live. Yeah, and so do you. We're
        not going to be exterminated. And I don't mean to be caught, either, and tamed, and
        fattened, and bred, like an ox. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> What are you going to do? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> I'm going on. . . right under their feet. I got a plan. We men as
        men are finished. We don't know enough. We gotta learn plenty before we've got a chance. And
        we've got to live and keep free while we learn, see? I've thought it all out, see. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Tell me the rest. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> Well, it isn't all of us that were made for wild beasts, and that's
        what it's got to be. That's why I watched YOU. All these little office workers that used to
        live in these houses -- they'd be no good. They haven't any stuff to 'em. They just used to
        run off to work. I've seen hundreds of 'em, running wild to catch their commuter train in
        the morning for fear they'd get canned if they didn't; running back at night afraid they
        won't be in time for dinner. Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents. And
        on Sundays, worried about the hereafter. The Martians will be a godsend for those guys. Nice
        roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, no worries. After a week or so chasing about the
        fields on empty stomachs they'll come and be glad to be caught. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> You've thought it all out, haven't you? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> You bet I have! And that isn't all. These Martians will make pets of
        some of 'em, train 'em to do tricks. Who knows? Get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up
        and had to be killed. . . And some, maybe, they'll train to hunt us. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> No, that's impossible. No human being. . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> Yes they will. There's men who'll do it gladly. If one of them ever
        comes after me, why. . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> In the meantime, you and I and others like us. . . where are we to
        live when the Martians own the earth? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> I've got it all figured out. We'll live underground. I've been
        thinking about the sewers. Under New York are miles and miles of 'em. The main ones are big
        enough for anybody. Then there's cellars, vaults, underground storerooms, railway tunnels,
        subways. You begin to see, eh? And we'll get a bunch of strong men together. No weak ones;
        that rubbish -- out. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> And you meant me to go? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> Well, I gave you a chance, didn't I? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> We won't quarrel about that. Go on. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> And we've got to make safe places for us to stay in, see, and get
        all the books we can -- science books. That's where men like you come in, see? We'll raid
        the museums, we'll even spy on the Martians. It may not be so much we have to learn before
        -- just imagine this: four or five of their own fighting machines suddenly start off -- heat
        rays right and left and not a Martian in 'em. Not a Martian in 'em! But MEN -- men who have
        learned the way how. It may even be in our time. Gee! Imagine having one of them lovely
        things with it's heat ray wide and free! We'd turn it on Martians, we'd turn it on men. We'd
        bring everybody down to their knees. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> That's your plan? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr> You, and me, and a few more of us we'd own the world. </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> I see. . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>STRANGER:</spkr>
        <stage>FADING OUT</stage> Say, what's the matter? . . . Where are you going? </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> Not to your world. . . Goodbye, stranger. . . </sp>
    <sp><spkr>PIERSON:</spkr> After parting with the artilleryman, I came at last to the Holland
        Tunnel. I entered that silent tube anxious to know the fate of the great city on the other
        side of the Hudson. Cautiously I came out of the tunnel and made my way up Canal Street. I
        reached Fourteenth Street, and there again were black powder and several bodies, and an evil
        ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses. I wandered up through
        the Thirties and Forties; I stood alone on Times Square. I caught sight of a lean dog
        running down Seventh Avenue with a piece of dark brown meat in his jaws, and a pack of
        starving mongrels at his heels. He made a wide circle around me, as though he feared I might
        prove a fresh competitor. I walked up Broadway in the direction of that strange powder --
        past silent shopwindows, displaying their mute wares to empty sidewalks -- past the Capitol
        Theatre, silent, dark -- past a shooting gallery, where a row of empty guns faced an
        arrested line of wooden ducks. Near Columbus Circle I noticed models of 1939 motorcars in
        the showrooms facing empty streets. From over the top of the General Motors Building, I
        watched a flock of black birds circling in the sky. I hurried on. Suddenly I caught sight of
        the hood of a Martian machine, standing somewhere in Central Park, gleaming in the late
        afternoon sun. An insane idea! I rushed recklessly across Columbus Circle and into the Park.
        I climbed a small hill above the pond at Sixtieth Street. From there I could see, standing
        in a silent row along the mall, nineteen of those great metal Titans, their cowls empty,
        their great steel arms hanging listlessly by their sides. I looked in vain for the monsters
        that inhabit those machines. Suddenly, my eyes were attracted to the immense flock of black
        birds that hovered directly below me. They circled to the ground, and there before my eyes,
        stark and silent, lay the Martians, with the hungry birds pecking and tearing brown shreds
        of flesh from their dead bodies. Later when their bodies were examined in the laboratories,
        it was found that they were killed by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which
        their systems were unprepared. . . slain, after all man's defenses had failed, by the
        humblest thing that God in His wisdom put upon this earth. Before the cylinder fell there
        was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty
        surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. Dim and wonderful is the vision I have
        conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seedbed of the solar system
        throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a remote dream. It may be
        that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, is the
        future ordained perhaps. Strange it now seems to sit in my peaceful study at Princeton
        writing down this last chapter of the record begun at a deserted farm in Grovers Mill.
        Strange to see from my window the university spires dim and blue through an April haze.
        Strange to watch children playing in the streets. Strange to see young people strolling on
        the green, where the new spring grass heals the last black scars of a bruised earth. Strange
        to watch the sightseers enter the museum where the dissembled parts of a Martian machine are
        kept on public view. Strange when I recall the time when I first saw it, bright and
        clean-cut, hard, and silent, under the dawn of that last great day. <stage>MUSIC SWELLS UP AND
            OUT</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp><spkr>ORSON WELLES:</spkr> This is Orson Welles, ladies and gentlemen, out of character to
        assure you that The War of The Worlds has no further significance than as the holiday
        offering it was intended to be. The Mercury Theatre's own radio version of dressing up in a
        sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying Boo! Starting now, we couldn't soap all your
        windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night. . . so we did the best next
        thing. We annihilated the world before your very ears, and utterly destroyed the C. B. S.
        You will be relieved, I hope, to learn that we didn't mean it, and that both institutions
        are still open for business. So goodbye everybody, and remember the terrible lesson you
        learned tonight. That grinning, glowing, globular invader of your living room is an
        inhabitant of the pumpkin patch, and if your doorbell rings and nobody's there, that was no
        Martian. . .it's Hallowe'en. <stage>MERCURY THEATRE THEME UP FULL, THEN DOWN</stage>
