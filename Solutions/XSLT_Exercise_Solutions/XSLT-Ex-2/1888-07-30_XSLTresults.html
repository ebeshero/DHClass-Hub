      <p>
         Tuesday, July 10, according to instructions from THE
         TIMES, I made up for the role of shop-girl, and with a
         list of factories in one hand and gentle peace in the other sailed down State
         street under a brown braise veil as impenetrable as an iron mask. I applied
         at two feather factories and three corset shops, but aside from the exercise up and down
         several flights of stairs got nothing. The feather people did not need any help and
         the
         corset folks had not started on the winter trade. <span class="good">I was treated with civility, however, and
            given permission to “drop in a week or so.”</span> The fifth place on my list was the
         <span class="company">“Western Lace Manufacturing Co.”</span> 218 State street. Ascending one
         flight of stairs I stopped to take off my veil and adjust my eyes to the low light.
         That
         done I looked about and finding a door marked ”Office of the <span class="company">Western Lace
            Manufacturing Co.</span>” with “Come In” on the glass I complied. A young girl
         followed and leaving her to close the door I fell into a chair, the only one about,
         and
         proceeded to perspire and scrutinize the place. <span class="good">The
            office was not uninviting. The flow had a cheap carpet, the ceiling was high and the
            room well ventilated and admirable lighted.</span> On a long table, that
         served as a sort of fortification for the private office of the company, were the
         samples—“antique crocheted good”—as they are listed, in various shades of white. All
         were of
         different pattern and unvarying ugliness. There were round tidies and oblong tidies,
         square
         mats for a bureau and smaller ones of oval and circular design, intended for a lamp
         or
         cushion. Behind the table, sachetiny between a writing stand and a desk, was a young man of
         30 or so, of blonde type, with a stationary scowl between his eyebrows and [missing word(s)]
         otherwise pleasing manner. That is, I thought the manner pleasing till I began to
         get
         acquainted with it and then my opinion changed. After a lapse of five minutes or so the
         fair-haired gentlemen turned to the young girl with a deepening of the [missing word(s)] and a most
         unalluring <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Well?”</span>*.[missing word(s)] *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“I brought the mate back.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Oh, you have, eh?”</span>*</span><br /><br /> opening a piece
         of newspaper and unfolding a dozen hand-made mats the size of a tea-plate. <span class="bad">The work is
            carefully examined on both sides and as he proceeds the scowl deepens. Without a word
            he
            tosses the lot on the little table and reaches for the proffered black the girl had
            opened.</span>
         <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“What’s your name?”</span>* *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“Rhafferty.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“How do you spell it?”</span>*
            *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“R-h-a-f-f-e-r-t-y.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Oh, yes; Martha Rhafferty,”</span>* after hunting through
            a long list. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Do you want more work?”</span>* *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“No, sir.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“There’s plenty more if you want it.”</span>* *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“No;
               my mother don’t want me to do any more crocheting.</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Well, Mr. White
               isn’t in now. Can’t you come in again?”</span>* No answer. A look of discouragement comes over the
            young face. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Don’t you have to do any shopping about town?”</span>* *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“No, sir.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Well, you can wait,
               can’t you? Wait here. Take a chair.</span>* (I had the only one.) *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">Just go in the next room there and
               take a chair.</span>*</span><br /><br /> As he went to lead the way the crochet-teacher called his attention, and the
         girl remaining I seized my chances for a bit of interviewing. Martha showed me her contract,
         in which <span class="bad">the firm agreed to refund $1 of the $3 deposited when she had finished $15 worth of
            work</span>. On the back of the contract were the credit receipts of the company entered in lead
         pencil, dating from January to July. She told me she lived in Gross Park, away out on the
         West side that she helped her mother, and had been trying to earn $15 since January. She
         received <span class="bad">60 cents a dozen for the mats and it took her a week to crochet a dozen</span>. <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“Then I
               must pay 10 cents car fare each time, and that leaves only 40 cents. I had to pay $3 before I
               could get any work. I always knew how to crochet, but they made me pay $2 for lessons and $1
               as a security. I began in January, the first week, and now I am through. <span class="bad">I have made $15,
                  and when they give me back the dollar I shall have $16.</span>”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">Here is a company paying a girl of
               18 $15 for six months and one week’s labor.</span>*</span><br /><br /> When Mr. Ford came from the
         work-room he was met by a boy who had brought in some work and was in a hurry to be off.
         <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice"> “Mrs. Clark sent these mats and she, wants you to receipt for
               them.”</span>* The paper is opened and the work inspected. The scowl deepens. There will be trouble
            and I prick up my ears. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“I don’t like this. This is bad. They are all stained. Are you
               her—her—are you a relation?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Yes.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Well, you must tell her to wash her hands. These goods
               are all sweet. I’ll have to charge her for spoilage the material if it occurs again.
               Did she
               tell you to ask for more work?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“No, sir.”</span>*</span><br /><br /> The poor boy is gone. Martha sits in the back
         room the picture of [missing word(s)] and the entry being made I am approached.
         I look like a beggar and that is what I am taken for, as, the pretty
         blonde secretary only scowls. He stands and looks down at me and I
         sit and look up at him waiting for the, lines in the handsome brow to deepen, the
         edge of
         the soft, brown mustache to curl, and the laconic, withering <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“well”</span>* to break the gaze. It
            comes. *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Have you any work?”</span>* I ask. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Plenty.” Do you want work?”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Yes.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“What can you do?”</span>*
            *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice"> “Oh, I can crochet.”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“This kind of work?”</span>* handing over one of the 60-cent mats. *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Yes; what
               do you pay?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Different prices. Pay by the dozen, from 60 cents to $10.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Let me have a
               dozen of the $10 kind, please,</span>*</span><br /><br />giving my cat-colored eyes a mater doloroso sort

         As he caught the seraphic expression some facial machinery gave a lurch that threw
         on side
         of his countenance bias for a second. Reaching to the desk he pulled out the following
         circular and handed it to me. <span class="neutral"><span class="company">OFFICE OF WESTERN LACE MANUFACTURING CO.
               (Incorporated)</span>, 218 STATE STREET, CHICAGO,
            ILL—[missing word(s)]: In reply to your letter regarding the work we send
            out to ladies to do at their homes we beg to say that we make a large line of crochet
            goods
            of our antique crochet cotton a sample of which you will find enclosed, also linen,
            silk,
            etc. We make mats, tidies, lambrequins, bedspreads, shams, collars, hood, lace edging, etc.,
            in large quantities. We have been established here for the last five years and have
            extra
            facilities for selling goods in large lost: so we are enabled to keep our workers
            in steady
            work all the time. Should you desire to work for us we should be pleased to send you
            work on
            the following terms: When you send order for work you are required to remit to us
            $3: $2 of
            this is to pay us for the patterns and instructions which we shall send you with each
            lot of
            new work. We shall also send you sufficient extra material so you can make a sample
            of each
            pattern sent, which you are allowed to keep for yourself; $1 of the $3 you send is a deposit
            on the material we send, and this we shall return to you at any time when you return
            the
            work and wish to stop. You will be kept in steady work, paid for each lot when made
            and
            re-turned to us in good order. Our work is all made by the dozen, and prices range
            from 50
            cents per dozen to $10 per dozen, according to amount of work. An easy pattern, with sample
            and full instructions, will be sent you at first, and the quality of work, and advance
            in
            prices as you adapt yourself to do-ing it. The work will be sent you by mail, post-age
            paid
            by us one way. Three month’s time is allowed you to do any one dozen of articles we
            send.
            This enables ladies who have only a few hours daily to spare to do our work as well
            as those
            ladies who take it intending to do it steadily. We are asked many times how much a
            lady can
            earn. This depends entirely upon your ability to crochet and the time you have at
            your
            command daily; ladies earning from $2 to $3 weekly. We could not guarantee to anyone any
            stated amount that they could earn, but our work is easy and after you accustom yourself
            to
            it you can do it very rapidly. If you desire work for us fill out the blank be-low
            and
            return it to us with the $3, and we will place your name on our books and send work at once
            with full instructions. Send your money by post-office order, draft, payable to our
            order,
            or registered letter at our risk. Very Truly, <span class="company">WESTERN LACE MANUFACTURING

            you to secure patterns, instructions, and material for crochet work; $2 is to pay
            you for

               for?”</span>* I ask. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Can’t you read? The $2 is to pay for the samples and instruction and the $1 as
               a security for our material. I don’t know who you are and if I gave you the thread
               I might
               never see you again.” “I don’t need instruction. I can make the stitch and I don’t
               want to
               put any such amount in samples.</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">If you can’t trust me with a spool of thread and a pattern
               will you sell me the material?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“That’s not the way we do business. If you want to work for
               us you will have to comply with the contract. You pay $3; that entitles you to a sample mat
               which we teach you how to make. After you have $15 made worth of work we refund the $1.”</span>*
            *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice"> “What about the other $2?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“It goes to us for instruction and samples.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Will I have to make
               the samples?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Yes.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">Then there are thirteen in the <span class="company">Western Lace Manufacturing

               set.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“But I don’t want any. I have a supply. Tell me how much will you sell me a thirteenth
               of a dozen of this set for?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“The price is on the tag.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Ah. I see 15 cents: and you pay 60
               cents a dozen for making them, a profit of $1.20. The best thing I’ve struck yet. And stock
               for sale?”</span>* The scowl becomes threatening, but I venture to ask how much thread it takes to
            mat for a closer calculation of the profits. No answer is deigned. *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“If I give you $3 you
               will give me work?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Yes,”</span>* in a sullen tone. *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“How much?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“All you can do,”</span>* brightening up a
            little. *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“How do I know you will give me back $1 after I’ve earned $15?”</span>* I ask. *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“I don’t know
               anything about you. I never heard of your firm before and there is no name on this
               paper.”</span>*
            *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“I guess your motives are bad. You don’t want work.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“What guarantee have you to offer of
               honesty or respectability?”</span>* With glaring eyes, distended nostrils, and face crimson with
            rage he threw down a pile of 2-cent blank books in front of me. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“There’s our customers:
               every state in the union is represented; go to them if you want references. Here are
               more
               too.”</span>* slamming down a sheet of paper with names and Chicago addresses of about forty women.
            *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">‘I see you have a minimum local trade. Chicago women don’t seem overzealous about
               the
               crocheting business.”</span>* Then I asked him where he got a market for the goods and the name of
            some business man to whom I could go for reference. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Now I am not going to do any more
               talking with you about this business.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Why?? Is it a secret organization, a sort of
               Maso[missing word(s)]”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“No. It isn’t secret or Ma[missing word(s)] either, but I don’t believe you’re all
               right and I won’t answer any more questions until I know who you are and what you
               want.”</span>*</span><br /><br />
         Poor Mr. Ford was so furious by this time that I thanked him for his
         attention and bade him good afternoon. At the foot of the stairs I waited to tie my
         veil on
         and see how Martha fared, but at the expiration of thirty minutes she
         was still waiting for Mr. White and her [missing word(s)].
         <span class="bad">Of the five women I interrogated none were able to earn 20 cents a
            day</span>. All expressed a liking for the work but
         complained bitterly of the way the [missing word(s)] gave out the work. For
         instance bedspreads paid $10 a dozen, but not more than three spreads were given to a hand
         and one of these was the sample. The little tablemats paid 50 cents per dozen, but before a
         girl was able to crochet enough to live on she was obliged to take collars made of
         line
         thread in such an intricate pattern that it was an utter impossibility to earn $1 a month.
         <span class="bad"> No woman seen had earned $15 in less than six months, and one of the most skilled hands had
            been on a 60-cent lot since June 3.</span> <span class="bad">By inquiry I learned that many women
            paid $3 and gave up the work when they saw it was not possible to make the $15 necessary
            for the rebate. </span> This fact does not appear in the circulars, and it
         is not [missing word(s)] after the contract has been signed that the [missing word(s)] tacties of the
         concern are understood. 
         Several cases are on record at the Woman’s Protective
         agency, but no judgment has been obtained, as the agreement [missing word(s)] valid
         be-fore the law. All that can be done in the matter is to warn the public against
         a
         [missing word(s)] legally incorporated to grind the life out of the women and girls unfortunate
         enough to patronize it.
         At <span class="company">Rosenthal &amp; Co.’s and Rosenberg Bros</span>. I applied for work and was
         told to report in the morning to sew on cloaks. The manager in
         <span class="company">Stein’s</span>, on Market street, wanted bands and
         offered to engage me at once. I was most impudently catechized some seven inquires
         requiring
         as many false statements. What was my name, place of residence, last position, amount
         of
         wages received, state of my health, nativity, <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">married or single</span>*—to which I
            answered *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“neither.”</span>* Here was a dilemma. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Oh, yes, widow?”</span>* and
            an inordinate ha! ha!
            *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">Yes.</span>*
            *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Grass widow, eh?” with a sneer.</span>*
            *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">How much do you pay for cloaks</span>*, I asked, tired of the ordeal
            *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Fifty cents, each.”</span>*</span><br /><br /> It was enough and I left the creature still anxious to solve the widow question.
         By the time I reached <span class="company">Ludden’s</span>, 122 Market
         street, I was in a reckless frame of mind. <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Is there any
               work for a good sewer?”</span>* I asked the girl in the office. *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“Yes, plenty.
               John give her some pants.”</span>*</span><br /><br /> John had eyes the
         color of calico and a complexion like an immature tomato. He led the way to the cottonades,
         which were cut, trimmed, and tied up in bundles of a dozen garments each. <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Here’s a sample,”</span>*
            holding up a pair of overalls of brown cottonade. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“The work is cut out, but you will have to do everything yourself. I want you to make
               the fly extra strong and press the buttons. <span class="bad">We
                  pay 75 cents a dozen</span> and you <span class="bad">find your own thread</span>.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“Seventy-five cents for a dozen of these
               pants and find my own thread?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Yes. <span class="bad">Or I’ll pay you 80 cents a dozen and give you linen thread if you sew the buttons on fast</span>.”</span>* *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“No. I guess I won’t take the pants. What other work
               have you?”</span>* *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“Here are cheviot shirts if you’d rather. Gusset the tail here and the sleeves,
               stay the bosom and arm-holes, and make the collar and wrist-bands extra strong. <span class="bad">These pay 75
                  cents a dozen.</span>”</span>* He offered to give me three on trial. <span class="bad">The thread would cost 5 cents,
               car-fare 10 cents, and I should have 3 cents after the job.</span> John said:
            *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“That’s so, but I can’t help it. If the work is satisfactory you can have a six-dozen
               lot.”</span>*
            It was very good of John to sympathise with me, but I thanked him and
            said I would look a little further.</span><br /><br /> At the
         <span class="company">Never-Rip Jersey Company</span> I was told to
         apply at the factory 133 West Washington street. “Work is given out at
         7:30 a. m.,” the clerk informed me, “and if you have any snap about you you can make
         a good
         living. By the way of getting the required snap I went home, ate my dinner, and was
         in bed
         at 8 o’ clock. The next morning I resumed the rags of poverty and at 7 o’clock made my debut
         as the factory hand. <span class="bad">I was one of 120 women, ranging in age from 15 to
            60</span>. The factory where the never-rip jerseys are made is
         at the corner of Washington and Union streets, with the elevator
         entrance in the rear and workroom in the fifth story. The girls began to arrive at
         7
         o’clock, and at every trip of the elevator some twenty or more were carried up-stairs.
         I
         took a chair in one of the machine rows, and for an hour did nothing but watch the
         preparations for work in that <span class="bad">human hive</span>. <span class="bad">The room was
            50x138, with an open unfinished roof and brick walls calcimined</span>. Light was admitted from
         rear and side windows. <span class="bad">The pressmen had their boards and furnaces at the south end of the
            room, where all the work was pressed prior to being boxed and ticketed for the trade.
            At the
            extreme opposite end was the cutting-room, fenced in from the rest, and between the
            two were
            the worktables, where the hundred odd girls stitched and finished the jerseys.</span>
         Along the brick walls were nails, irregularly driven, on which the girls hung their
         hats and
         wraps, dresses and collars. Nearly every one took off her dress and waisit, turned
         it inside
         out, put it on a nail and put on a calico of old stuff shop suit. A few took off their
         corsets and nearly all the machine hands changed their shoes before work. On the stroke
         of
         7:30 a bell rang, the power was turned on <span class="bad">the machines began to buzz like little saw-mills
            and the day’s work had commenced</span>. <span class="bad">Heads of brown, black, yellow, and gray bent so near the
            flying shuttles that every minute I experted the bangs and fluffy crimps would get
            caught in
            the machinery. </span> The faces were sad and so very, very pales that I
         shall never look at a jersey again without seeing
         them.
         <span class="bad">The average age may have been 23, but not less.</span>
         <span class="bad">There were girls of 17 and 18 and some world-weary women past 50 all
            working for little more than enough to keep body and soul together.</span>
         The work circulated in baskets—long chip hampers with stout-handles—that held a dozen,
         with
         room for five times that quantity. <span class="bad">A great deal of time was lost by the
            workers in getting the contents of the basket examined, checked off on the ticket
            and
            the ticket stamped.</span>
         If it had been the last change for life I don’t believe the girls would have worked
         any harder for salvation. Scarcely a head was raised from machine or lap.
         <span class="bad">Shoulders were bent down, chests hollowed in, and
            faces drooped so low that I could not begin to make a study of the “windows of the
            souls” before me.</span> At 8:40 the proprietor of the
         chair I was in asked me to vacate, and I walked down through the narrow aisles of
         sewing-women to the “forelady” and asked for work.
         She asked me if I wanted to take a machine, but I expressed a preference for finishing.
         I
         was given a numbers, a basket with five jerseys to finish, and a chair beside a
         girl named Hannah, who, being engaged by the way was told to “show me.”
         Hannah had blonde hair and talked with the brogue. <span class="bad">She gave me a
            needle as long as my engagement finger, and the most meager instruction compatible
            with
            obedience. Fortunately I had my thimble and crossing my knees I threaded the
            gimlet-like needle with silk and I proceeded to
            hook-and-eye a jersey.</span> Remembering the treachery of
         my shop clothes I ever wore filled the two hooks and eyes with sewing and after testing
         them
         proceeded to face the collar. I told Hannah about my misery, but she
         wisely said it was no fault of hers and went on with a <span class="bad">$3-a-dozen lot she had been doing two
            days and a half</span>. <span class="good">Thinking it would be a good way to get acquainted with my neighbors I asked
            several for a fine needle and at last exchanged the crow-bar Hannah had
            given me for a line cambric article. It worked better</span> and at the end of two
         hours I had bound the arm-holes,
         faced the collar,
         tacked the front facing and the bustle
         piece, and put two patts of hooks and eyes in a black jersey. <span class="bad">The
            dye was not fast, neither was the wool, for my throat, ears,
            and nostrils were tufted with black lint. I was African from the nails to the wrists.</span> The
         front facings had to be trimmed off. I had no scissors. Hannah was
         dangerous with her, and <span class="bad">I lost about 15 cents worth of time borrowing the weapons.</span>
         <span class="bad">At noon I had finished four jerseys and was
            so sore about the neck and back that I could scarcely rise from the
            chair.</span> <span class="good">I began to scent hot tea, and looking about saw
            a big girl called Emma brewing three pots of Japan over one of the
            press furnaces. She had her front hair in curl papers and was whistling “In The Sweet
            Bye
            and Bye.” About thirty girls went to her, each with her own cup, for a supply of tea.
            I
            remarked to one passing my chair that her tea looked awfully nice and asked where
            she got
            it. “From Em. She makes it and we each pay 2 cents a week.”</span> <span class="bad">On the
            stroke of 12 the machine stopped and 120 tired women stopped too, for thirty minutes’
            rest
            and the food that could hardly be called refreshing. In the main it consisted of brown
            bread
            and butter. In some parcels there was cold meat and cake: others had pie; a few a
            bottle or
            canteen of milk, cold tea or coffee, but I did not see a particle of fruit.</span> One little girl
         who had been stretching jerseys at 2 cents each made a lunch on three graham
         crackers and a piece of custard pie, which she ate reading a paper-covered book. I
         counted
         thirty-seven girls with a lunch of dry bread, fifteen with sandwiches, and ten who
         ate cold
         pancakes. Twenty-three girls were without any luncheon whatever. During the intermission the
         elevator stopped running and no one left the building but myself. Less than ten minutes
         was
         spent over the wretched mea. <span class="bad">At one side of the west wall, separated by a
            ten-foot pine partition, was the toilet-room containing an iron zinc with one faucet
            of
            running water.</span>
         <span class="bad">Here the girls crowded like so many cattle</span>, each with her
         bit of soap and grimy cotton towel, to wash. Dress waists were loosened and necks,
         faces,
         arms, and hands lathered with soap and rinsed, as the change permitted. <span class="bad">There were three
            closets, unflushed, untidy, and unwholesome. Set up against the wall in this enclosure,
            with
            the faucet run through the partition, was a barrel of ice water inscribed in big letters:
            “Two cents will be collected every Saturday for ice
            water.”</span> <span class="bad">Besides this luxury every hand pays 12 cents a week for the
            use of the machine.</span> At 1 o’clock I finished my basket, which I dragged to
         Tom, the book-keeper, who took my name and credited me with five
         garments. <span class="bad">No price had been put on the jerseys, as they were sampled goods, but
            the forelady thought they would go at 60 cents a dozen, which meant 25 cents to my credit.</span> I
         didn’t get any more work till 2 o’clock because the forelady was in the
         toilet-room having her bangs done up in paper. She was a pretty woman, by the way,
         with a
         good face and a shock of beautiful auburn hair. She had been in her position for six
         years
         and was drawing a salary of $35 a week. The girls had a good word for her generally, but she
         struck me as being a woman without heart. At her appearance I was given a basketful of
         jerseys to finish button-holes. <span class="bad">I
            worked like a Trojan for an hour</span>, at the end of which I won the heart
         of a little girl who sat at the end of my table facing the wall. She had been sitting still
         so long that I called out and asked if she were ill. “No. I haven’t any work.”
         <span class="bad">Tired almost to exhaustion and as
            hot as a newly-built mustard plaster I was only too glad of a chance to transfer
            my interests, but she declined.</span>
         It was too hot to work; she was going away soon, she said, and didn’t care to do any
         more.
         “When did I begin? Today. I worked in a box-factory, but it was so dull I could only earn 16
         cents a day. My mother wants me to pay her $2.50 a week board, but how could I with 96
         cents. This is no better. I came at 8 this morning and I have only made 11 cents. I am 21.
         Beaus? Yes, some. I have on steady fellow, but I don’t know if he will marry me. I
         hope he
         will. She told me he earned <span class="bad">75$ a month as a telegraph operator on the board of trade</span>; that
         he was “steady as a steeple, and the only fellow she ever loved.” <span class="good">I told her how to go about
            catching the prosperous telegrapher and rehashed a recipe given me by no less a personage
            than Mrs. John M. Sherwood, which I had never tried. She was going to a
            picnic at Garfield park at 6 o’clock and brought over a 25-cent
            chocolate cake to show me. Then she loaned me her scissors, told me good-by, and went
            home
            to dress for the fete.</span> Nothing of any importance occurred till someone passed the news that
         a girl was asleep in the closet. Half a dozen left their machines to look at her,
         Hannah, my mentor, among them. “Oh, you just ought to see her, fast
         asleep, with her mouth wide open.” It was more than I could stand. I threw my
         button-holes into the basket and went to the toiletroom.
          Sure enough, there was the poor girl sitting in the dirty place, her
         head resting against a folded apron, breathing in the foul air that reeked with filth
         and disease. The walls of the closet were black with pencil marks,
         the floor was strewn with lint and threads, and the pale face of the sleeper looked
         ghastly
         in the darkness. She had tied one end of a string to the latch and the other to the
         drop
         chain. <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">“My dear child, musnt’t sleep here. Are you sick?”</span>* *Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice">“Oh, I am so sick.”</span>*</span><br /><br />
         <span class="good">Instantly there were a dozen willing hands to help her out to a window
            where a chair was placed for her. We rubbed her temples, chafed her hands, bathed
            her
            head, and got her some lemons.</span> After making her toilet she came over to my
         table as I sewed away at my button-holes she told me her story.
         <br /><br /><span class="dialogue">*Female Speaker:<span class="femVoice"> “Rose and I are only six months in this country. We came from
               England with our brother and live on Carpenter
               street. The climate doesn’t agree with me and I am sick all the time. At
               first we worked in <span class="company">Marshall Field’s</span> and Rose and I
               made fringe. <span class="bad">We got $7 a week and were so happy.</span> <span class="good">It was awful nice there. We didn’t have to
                  pay for drinking water or anything; there were lots of towels, whole cakes of soap,
                  and oh,
                  it was so clean. We had a foreman over us and he was as good as a brother to us. Sometimes
                  we let our money lay and drew it in a pile; oh, such a lot as it was! We put away
                  very much
                  of it.</span> But I got sick and all we ‘ad saved went for doctor and medicine. Then the work
               stopped. They took our names though and promised to send for us in the fall. For a
               while we
               worked in the box factory, but liked to starve. Then we went to
               <span class="company">Ellinger’s</span> and <span class="bad">made cloaks at 30 cents each, but it was
                  so hard, and we couldn’t please them no matter how we tried.</span> <span class="bad">We came here today, but it’s
                  only a fit place to starve in. All the work they gave me was a dozen jerseys to
                  button; that’s 11 cents a row; had two dozen holes to finish at 16 cents. Twenty-seven cents
                  for the two of us! How can we live on it?</span>”</span>* and the child began to cry again. *Nell Nelson:<span class="nellVoice">By way of
               comforting her I took her name, promised to help her, and gave her my check for 41 cents.</span>*
            She didn’t think it would be honored so I took it to the cashier myself and demanded
            pay as
            I was not coming back in the morning. *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“No, ma’am,”</span>* said Tom, *Male Speaker:<span class="mascVoice">“you don’t
               get it. Come round on the 20th and I hunt you up.”</span>*</span><br /><br /> At 5:30 work ceased. <span class="bad">Each girl had to
            sweep out her place, clean and oil the machine, and return her basket and check.</span> I paid a
         nickel to have my corner swept, and finding it impossible to wash up sans towel and
         soap I
         got under my veil and rang the elevator. The pressers laughed and told me to try the
         stairs—five flights. Down I went. At the second I went into the salesroom to buy a
         jersey. One of the firm waited on me; his magnanimity was sublime. The
         identical black jersey that I had received 5 centsfor finishing was offered to
         me at $2. I declined. <span class="bad">By way of interest, one hundred dozen garments are turned out of the
            factory every day in the year. As near as I could learn the salaries average $4 a
            week, but
            plenty of grown women are not allowed to earn over 28 cents a day. Work begins at
            7:30 a. m.
            and 12:30 p. m. Anyone five minutes late working on time is fined an hour’s pay, and
            for the
            loss of an hour the pay of half a day is knocked off. Piece-workers who are late are
            kept
            idle form one to three hours. A girl who loses her ticket forfeits pay for the entire
            work,
            not withstanding the entry is on the books of the firm.</span>
