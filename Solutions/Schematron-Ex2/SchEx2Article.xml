                <p>You can do anything with tokenize(). You can divide
                    text into words, breaking on white space, on punctuation, or in
                    any other way that meets your needs. You can even use tokenize()
                    in a nested context, perhaps breaking on white space and then,
                    within each white-space-delimited word, on hyhpens. How cool is
                    that!</p>

                <p>Gratta’s attention to tokenize() is misplaced. matches() is much more useful.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, though, contains() alone is enough.
