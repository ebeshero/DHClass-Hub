         <p><strong><span class="speaker">ORSON WELLES:</span></strong> We know now that in the early years of the twentieth century
            this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as
            mortal
            as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various
            concerns
            they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope
            might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
            With
            infinite complacence people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs,
            serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar
            driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time
            and
            Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that to our minds as ours are to
            the
            beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth
            with
            envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the thirty-ninth
            year of
            the twentieth century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October.
            Business was better. The war scare was over. More men were back at work. Sales were
            picking
            up. On this particular evening, October 30, the Crossley service estimated that thirty-two
            million people were listening in on radios.

            A slight atmospheric disturbance of undetermined origin is reported over Nova Scotia,
            causing a low pressure area to move down rather rapidly over the northeastern states,

            Illinois, reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas, occurring at regular
            intervals on the planet Mars. The spectroscope indicates the gas to be hydrogen and
            moving
            towards the earth with enormous velocity. Professor Pierson of the Observatory at
            Princeton
            confirms Farrell's observation, and describes the phenomenon as **<span class="stageDirection">quote) like a jet of

            bulletin a moment ago, the Government Meteorological Bureau has requested the large
            observatories of the country to keep an astronomical watch on any further disturbances
            occurring on the planet Mars. Due to the unusual nature of this occurance, we have
            arranged
            an interview with noted astronomer. Professor Pierson, who will give us his views
            on the
            event. in a few moments we will take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton,

         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Carl Phillips, speaking
            to you from the observatory at Princeton. I am standing in a large semi-circular room,
            pitch
            black except for an oblong split in the ceiling. Through this opening i can see a
            sprinkling
            of stars that cast a kind of frosty glow over the intricate mechanism of the huge
            telescope.
            The ticking sound you hear is the vibration of the clockwork. Professor Pierson stands
            directly above me on a small platform, peering through a giant lens. I ask you to
            be
            patient, ladies and gentlemen, during any delay that may arise during our interview.
            Besides
            his ceaseless watch of the heavens, Professor Pierson may be interrupted by telephone
            or
            other communications. During this period he is in constant touch with the astronomical
            centers of the world . . . Professor, may I begin our questions? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> At any time, Mr. Phillips. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Professor, would you please tell our radio audience exactly what you
            see as you observe the planet Mars through your telescope? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Nothing unusual at the moment, Mr. Phillips. A red disk swimming in a
            blue sea. Transverse stripes across the disk. Quite distinct now because Mars happens
            to be
            the point nearest the earth . . . in opposition, as we call it. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> In your opinion, what do these transverse stripes signify, Professor
            Pierson? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Not canals, I can assure you, Mr. Phillips, although that's the
            popular conjecture of those who imagine Mars to be inhabited. From a scientific viewpoint
            the stripes are merely the result of atmospheric conditions peculiar to the planet.
            
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Then you're quite convinced as a scientist that living intelligence
            as we know it does not exist on Mars? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> I'd say the chances against it are a thousand to one. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> And yet how do you account for those gas eruptions occurring on the
            surface of the planet at regular intervals? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Mr. Phillips, I cannot account for it. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> By the way, Professor, for the benefit of our listeners, how far is
            Mars from earth? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Approximately forty million miles. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Well, that seems a safe enough distance. **<span class="stageDirection">OFF MIKE</span>** Thank
            you. **<span class="stageDirection">PAUSE</span>**
            
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, someone has just handed
            Professor Pierson a message. While he reads it, let me remind you that we are speaking
            to
            you from the observatory in Princeton, New Jersey, where we are interviewing the world-
            famous astronomer, Professor Pierson . . . One moment, please. Professor Pierson has
            passed
            me a message which he has just received . . . Professor, may I read the message to
            the
            listening audience? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Certainly, Mr. Phillips 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Ladies and gentlemen, I shall read you a wire addressed to Professor
            Pierson from Dr. Gray of the National History Museum, New York. "9: 15 P.M. eastern
            standard
            time. Seismograph registered shock of almost earthquake intensity occurring within
            a radius
            of twenty miles of Princeton. Please investigate. Signed, Lloyd Gray, Chief of Astronomical
            Division" . . . Professor Pierson, could this occurrence possibly have something to
            do with
            the disturbances observed on the planet Mars? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Hardly, Mr. Phillips. This is probably a meteorite of unusual size
            and its arrival at this particular time is merely a coincidence. However, we shall
            conduct a
            search, as soon as daylight permits. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Thank you, Professor. Ladies and gentlemen, for the past ten minutes
            we've been speaking to you from the observatory at Princeton, bringing you a special
            interview with Professor Pierson, noted astronomer. This is Carl Phillips speaking.
            We are
            returning you now to our New York studio. **<span class="stageDirection">FADE IN PIANO PLAYING</span>**

         <p><strong><span class="speaker">ANNOUNCER TWO:</span></strong> Ladies and gentlemen, here is the latest bulletin from the
            Intercontinental Radio News. Toronto, Canada: Professor Morse of McGill University
            reports
            observing a total of three explosions on the planet Mars, between the hours of 7:
            45 P.M.
            and 9: 20 P.M., eastern standard time. This confirms earlier reports received from
            American
            observatories. Now, nearer home, comes a special announcement from Trenton, New Jersey.
            It
            is reported that at 8: 50 P.M. a huge, flaming object, believed to be a meteorite,
            fell on a
            farm in the neighborhood of Grovers Mill, New Jersey, twenty-two miles from Trenton.
            The
            flash in the sky was visible within a radius of several hundred miles and the noise
            of the
            impact was heard as far north as Elizabeth. We have dispatched a special mobile unit
            to the
            scene, and will have our commentator, Carl Phillips, give you a word description as
            soon as
            he can reach there from Princeton. In the meantime, we take you to the Hotel Martinet
            in
            Brooklyn, where Bobby Millette and his orchestra are offering a program of dance music.

         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Ladies and gentlemen, this is Carl Phillips again, at the Wilmuth
            farm, Grovers Mill, New Jersey. Professor Pierson and myself made the eleven miles
            from
            Princeton in ten minutes. Well, I . . . I hardly know where to begin, to paint for
            you a
            word picture of the strange scene before my eyes, like something out of a modern "Arabian
            Nights." Well, I just got here. I haven't had a chance to look around yet. I guess
            that's
            it. Yes, I guess that's the . . . thing, directly in front of me, half buried in a
            vast pit.
            Must have struck with terrific force. The ground is covered with splinters of a tree
            it must
            have struck on its way down. What I can see of the . . . object itself doesn't look
            very
            much like a meteor, at least not the meteors I've seen. It looks more like a huge
            cylinder.
            It has a diameter of . . . what would you say, Professor Pierson? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong>**<span class="stageDirection">OFF-MIKE</span>** What's that?

         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> About thirty yards.

         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> About thirty yards . . . The metal on the sheath is . . . well, I've
            never seen anything like it. The color is sort of yellowish-white. Curious spectators
            now
            are pressing close to the object in spite of the efforts of the police to keep them
            back.
            They're getting in front of my line of vision. Would you mind standing to one side,
            please?

            owner of the farm here. He may have some interesting facts to add . . . Mr. Wilmuth,
            would
            you please tell the radio audience as much as you remember of this rather unusual
            visitor
            that dropped in your backyard? Step closer, please. Ladies and gentlemen, this is

         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Well, were you frightened, Mr. Wilmuth?

         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Ladies and gentlemen, you've just heard Mr. Wilmuth, owner of the
            farm where this thing has fallen. I wish I could convey the atmosphere . . . the background
            of this . . . fantastic scene. Hundreds of cars are parked in a field in back of us.
            Police
            are trying to rope off the roadway leading to the farm. But it's no use. They're breaking
            right through. Cars' headlights throw an enormous spot on the pit where the object's
            half
            buried. Some of the more daring souls are now venturing near the edge. Their silhouettes
            stand out against the metal sheen. **<span class="stageDirection">FAINT HUMMING SOUND</span>** One man wants to touch the
            thing . . . he's having an argument with a policeman. The policeman wins. . . . Now,
            ladies
            and gentlemen, there's something I haven't mentioned in all this excitement, but now
            it's
            becoming more distinct. Perhaps you've caught it already on your radio. Listen: **<span class="stageDirection">LONG
               PAUSE</span>** . . . Do you hear it? It's a curious humming sound that seems to come from
            inside the object. I'll move the microphone nearer. **<span class="stageDirection">PAUSE</span>** Now we're not more then
            twenty-five feet away. Can you hear it now? Oh, Professor Pierson! 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Yes, Mr. Phillips? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Can you tell us the meaning of that scraping noise inside the thing? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Possibly the unequal cooling of its surface. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> I see, do you still think it's a meteor, Professor? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> I don't know what to think. The metal casing is definitely
            extraterrestrial . . . not found on this earth. Friction with the earth's atmosphere
            usually
            tears holes in a meteorite. This thing is smooth and, as you can see, of cylindrical
            shape. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Just a minute! Something's happening! Ladies and gentlemen, this is
            terrific! This end of the thing is beginning to flake off! The top is beginning to
            rotate
            like a screw! The thing must be hollow!

            . . .
            something. I can see peering out of that black hole two luminous disks . . are they
            eyes? It
            might be a face. It might be . . . **<span class="stageDirection">SHOUT OF AWE FROM THE CROWD</span>**
            
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PHILLIPS:</span></strong> Good heavens, something's wriggling out of the shadow like a gray
            snake. Now it's another one, and another. They look like tentacles to me. There, I
            can see
            the thing's body. It's large, large as a bear and it glistens like wet leather. But
            that
            face, it . . . Ladies and gentlemen, it's indescribable. I can hardly force myself
            to keep
            looking at it. The eyes are black and gleam like a serpent. The mouth is V-shaped
            with
            saliva dripping from its rimless lips that seem to quiver and pulsate. The monster
            or
            whatever it is can hardly move. It seems weighed down by . . . possibly gravity or
            something. The thing's raising up. The crowd falls back now. They've seen plenty.
            This is
            the most extraordinary experience. I can't find words . . . I'll pull this microphone
            with
            me as I talk. I'll have to stop the description until I can take a new position. Hold
            on,

            of the
            whole scene. I'll give you every detail as long as I can talk. As long as I can see.
            More
            state police have arrived They're drawing up a cordon in front of the pit, about thirty
            of
            them. No need to push the crowd back now. They're willing to keep their distance.
            The
            captain is conferring with someone. We can't quite see who. Oh yes, I believe it's
            Professor
            Pierson. Yes, it is. Now they've parted. The Professor moves around one side, studying
            the
            object, while the captain and two policemen advance with something in their hands.
            I can see
            it now. It's a white handkerchief tied to a pole . . . a flag of truce. If those creatures
            know what that means . . . what anything means!. . . Wait! Something's happening!

            opportunity. In the meantime, we have a late bulletin from San Diego, California.
            Professor
            Indellkoffer, speaking at a dinner of the California Astronomical Society, expressed
            the
            opinion that the explosions on Mars are undoubtedly nothing more than severe volcanic
            disturbances on the surface of the planet. We now continue with our piano interlude.

         <p><strong><span class="speaker">ANNOUNCER TWO:</span></strong> Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been handed a message that
            came in from Grovers Mill by telephone. Just a moment. At least forty people, including
            six
            state troopers lie dead in a field east of the village of Grovers Mill, their bodies
            burned
            and distorted beyond all possible recognition. The next voice you hear will be that
            of
            Brigadier General Montgomery Smith, commander of the state militia at Trenton, New
            Jersey. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">SMITH:</span></strong> I have been requested by the governor of New Jersey to place the
            counties of Mercer and Middlesex as far west as Princeton, and east to Jamesburg,
            under
            martial law. No one will be permitted to enter this area except by special pass issued
            by
            state or military authorities. Four companies of state militia are proceeding from
            Trenton
            to Grovers Mill, and will aid in the evacuation of homes within the range of military
            operations. Thank you. ANNOUNCER TWO You have just been listening to General Montgomery
            Smith commanding the state militia at Trenton. In the meantime, further details of
            the
            catastrophe at Grovers Mill are coming in. The strange creatures after unleashing
            their
            deadly assault, crawled back into their pit and made no attempt to prevent the efforts
            of
            the firemen to recover the bodies and extinguish the fire. Combined fire departments
            of
            Mercer County are fighting the flames which menace the entire countryside. We have
            been
            unable to establish any contact with our mobile unit at Grovers Mill, but we hope
            to be able
            to return you there at the earliest possible moment. In the meantime we take you --
            just one
            moment please. **<span class="stageDirection">LONG PAUSE</span>**
            **<span class="stageDirection">WHISPER</span>** Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been informed that we have finally
            established communication with an eyewitness of the tragedy. Professor Pierson has
            been
            located at a farmhouse near Grovers Mill where he has established an emergency observation
            post. As a scientist, he will give you his explanation of the calamity. The next voice
            you
            hear will be that of Professor Pierson, brought to you by direct wire. Professor Pierson.

         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Of the creatures in the rocket cylinder at Grovers Mill, I can give
            you no authoritative information -- either as to their nature, their origin, or their
            purposes here on earth Of their destructive instrument I might venture some conjectural
            explanation. For want of a better term, I shall refer to the mysterious weapon as
            a heat
            ray. It's all too evident that these creatures have scientific knowledge far in advance
            of
            our own. It is my guess that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat
            in a
            chamber of practically absolute nonconductivity. This intense heat they project in
            a
            parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror
            of
            unknown composition, much as the mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light.
            That is my
            conjecture of the origin of the heat ray . . . 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">ANNOUNCER TWO:</span></strong> Thank you, Professor Pierson. Ladies and gentlemen, here is a
            bulletin from Trenton. It is a brief statement informing us that the charred body
            of Carl
            Phillips has been identified in a Trenton hospital. Now here's another bulletin from
            Washington, D.C. Office of the director of the National Red Cross reports ten units
            of Red
            Cross emergency workers have been assigned to the headquarters of the state militia
            stationed outside Grovers Mill, New Jersey. Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton
            Junction: The fires at Grovers Mill and vicinity are now under control. Scouts report
            all
            quiet in the pit, and no sign of life appearing from the mouth of the cylinder . .
            . And
            now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a special statement from Mr. Harry McDonald, vice-
            president in charge of operations. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">MC DONALD:</span></strong> We have received a request from the militia at Trenton to place at
            their disposal our entire broadcasting facilities. In view of the gravity of the situation,
            and believing that radio has a responsibility to serve in the public interest at all
            times,
            we are turning over our facilities to the state militia at Trenton. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">ANNOUNCER TWO:</span></strong> We take you now to the field headquarters of the state militia
            near Grovers Mill, New Jersey. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">CAPTAIN:</span></strong> This is Captain Lansing of the signal corps, attached to the state
            militia now engaged in military operations in the vicinity of Grovers Mill. Situation
            arising from the reported presence of certain individuals of unidentified nature is
            now
            under complete control. The cylindrical object which lies in a pit directly below
            our
            position is surrounded on all sides by eight battalions of infantry. Without heavy
            field
            pieces, but adequately armed with rifles and machine guns. All cause for alarm, if
            such
            cause ever existed, is now entirely unjustified. The things, whatever they are, do
            not even
            venture to poke their heads above the pit. I can see their hiding place plainly in
            the glare
            of the searchlights here. With all their reported resources, these creatures can scarcely
            stand up against heavy machine-gun fire Anyway, it's an interesting outing for the
            troops. I
            can make out their khaki uniforms, crossing back and forth in front of the lights.
            It looks
            almost like a real war. There appears to be some slight smoke in the woods bordering
            the
            Millstone River. Probably fire started by campers. Well, we ought to see some action
            soon.
            One of the companies is deploying on the left flank. An quick thrust and it will all
            be
            over. Now wait a minute! I see something on top of the cylinder. No, it's nothing
            but a
            shadow. Now the troops are on the edge of the Wilmuth farm. Seven thousand armed men
            closing
            in on an old metal tube. Wait, that wasn't a shadow! It's something moving . . . solid
            metal
            . . . kind of shield-like affair rising up out of the cylinder . . . It's going higher
            and
            higher. Why, it's standing on legs . . . actually rearing up on a sort of metal framework.
            Now it's reaching above the trees and the searchlights are on it. Hold on! 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">ANNOUNCER:</span></strong> Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make.
            Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our
            eyes
            lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey
            farmlands tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars. The battle
            which took place tonight at Grovers Mill has ended in one of the most startling defeats
            ever
            suffered by any army in modern times; seven thousand men armed with rifles and machine
            guns
            pitted against a single fighting machine of the invaders from Mars. One hundred and
            twenty
            known survivors. The rest strewn over the battle area from Grovers Mill to Plainsboro,
            crushed and trampled to death under the metal feet of the monster, or burned to cinders
            by
            its heat ray. The monster is now in control of the middle section of New Jersey and
            has
            effectively cut the state through its center. Communication lines are down from Pennsylvania
            to the Atlantic Ocean. Railroad tracks are torn and service from New York to Philadelphia
            discontinued except routing some of the trains through Allentown and Phoenixville.
            Highways
            to the north, south, and west are clogged with frantic human traffic. Police and army
            reserves are unable to control the mad flight. By morning the fugitives will have
            swelled
            Philadelphia, Camden, and Trenton, it is estimated, to twice their normal population.
            At
            this time martial law prevails throughout New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. We
            take you
            now to Washington for a special broadcast on the National Emergency . . . the Secretary
            of

            citizens and public officials, all of you -- the urgent need of calm and resourceful
            action.
            Fortunately, this formidable enemy is still confined to a comparatively small area,
            and we
            may place our faith in the military forces to keep them there. In the meantime placing
            our

            Washington. Bulletins too numerous to read are piling up in the studio here. We are
            informed
            the central portion of New Jersey is blacked out from radio communication due to the
            effect
            of the heat ray upon power lines and electrical equipment. Here is a special bulletin
            from
            New York. Cables received from English, French, German scientific bodies offering
            assistance. Astronomers report continued gas outbursts at regular intervals on planet
            Mars.
            Majority voice opinion that enemy will be reinforced by additional rocket machines.
            Attempts
            made to locate Professor Pierson of Princeton, who has observed Martians at close
            range. It
            is feared he was lost in recent battle. Langham field, Virginia: Scouting planes report
            three Martian machines visible above treetops, moving north towards Somerville with
            population fleeing ahead of them. Heat ray not in use; although advancing at express-train
            speed, invaders pick their way carefully. They seem to be making conscious effort
            to avoid
            destruction of cities and countryside. However, they stop to uproot power lines, bridges,
            and railroad tracks. Their apparent objective is to crush resistance, paralyze
            communication, and disorganize human society. Here is a bulletin from Basking Ridge,
            New
            Jersey: Coon hunters have stumbled on a second cylinder similar to the first embedded
            in the
            great swamp twenty miles south of Morristown. Army field pieces are proceeding from
            Newark
            to blow up second invading unit before cylinder can be opened and the fighting machine
            rigged. They are taking up position in the -- foothills of Watchung Mountains. Another
            bulletin from Langham Field, Virginia: Scouting planes report enemy machines, now
            three in
            number, increasing speed northward kicking over houses and trees in their evident
            haste to
            form a conjunction with their allies south of Morristown. Machines also sighted by
            telephone
            operator east of Middlesex within ten miles of Plainfield. Here's a bulletin from
            Winston
            Field, Long Island: Fleet of army bombers carrying heavy explosives flying north in
            pursuit
            of enemy. Scouting planes act as guides. They keep speeding enemy in sight. Just a
            moment
            please. Ladies and gentlemen, we've run special wires to the artillery line in adjacent
            villages to give you direct reports in the zone of the advancing enemy. First we take
            you to
            the battery of the 22nd Field Artillery, located in the Watchtung Mountains.

         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> As I set down these notes on paper, I'm obsessed by the thought that
            I may be the last living man on earth. I have been hiding in this empty house near
            Grovers
            Mill -- a small island of daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the
            world.
            All that happened before the arrival of these monstrous creatures in the world now
            seems
            part of another life. . . a life that has no continuity with the present, furtive
            existence
            of the lonely derelict who pencils these words on the back of some astronomical notes
            bearing the signature of Richard Pierson. I look down at my blackened hands, my torn
            shoes,
            my tattered clothes, and I try to connect them with a professor who lives at Princeton,
            and
            who on the night of October 30, glimpsed through his telescope an orange splash of
            light on
            a distant planet. My wife, my colleagues, my students, my books, my observatory, my.
            . . my
            world. . . where are they? Did they ever exist? Am I Richard Pierson? What day is
            it? Do
            days exist without calendars? Does time pass when there are no human hands left to
            wind the
            clocks? . . .In writing down my daily life I tell myself I shall preserve human history
            between the dark covers of this little book that was meant to record the movements
            of the
            stars. . . But to write I must live, and to live, I must eat . . . I find moldy bread
            in the
            kitchen, and an orange not too spoiled to swallow. I keep watch at the window. From
            time to
            time I catch sight of a Martian above the black smoke. The smoke still holds the house
            in
            its black coil. . . but at length there is a hissing sound and suddenly I see a Martian
            mounted on his machine, spraying the air with a jet of steam, as if to dissipate the
            smoke.
            I watch in a corner as his huge metal legs nearly brush against the house. Exhausted
            by
            terror, I fall asleep. . .it's morning. . . **<span class="stageDirection">QUIETLY</span>** Morning! Sun streams in the
            window. The black cloud of gas has lifted, and the scorched meadows to the north look
            as
            though a black snowstorm has passed over them. I venture from the house. I make my
            way to a
            road. No traffic. Here and there a wrecked car, baggage overturned, a blackened skeleton.
            I
            push on north. For some reason I feel safer trailing these monsters than running away
            from
            them. And I keep a careful watch. I have seen the Martians. . . feed. Should one of
            their
            machines appear over the top of trees, I am ready to fling myself flat on the earth.
            I come
            to a chestnut tree. October chestnuts are ripe. I fill my pockets. I must keep alive.
            Two
            days I wander in a vague northerly direction through a desolate world. Finally I notice
            a
            living creature. . . a small red squirrel in a beech tree. I stare at him, and wonder.
            He
            stares back at me. I believe at that moment the animal and I shared the same emotion.
            . .the
            joy of finding another living being. I push on north. I find dead cows in a brackish
            field.
            Beyond, the charred ruins of a dairy. The silo remains standing guard over the waste
            land
            like a lighthouse deserted by the sea. Astride the silo perches a weathercock. The
            arrow
            points north. Next day I came to a city vaguely familiar in its contours, yet its
            buildings
            strangely dwarfed and leveled off, as if a giant hand sliced off its highest towers
            with a
            capricious sweep of his hand. I reached the outskirts. I found Newark, undemolished,
            but
            humbled by some whim of the advancing Martians. Presently, with an odd feeling of
            being
            watched, I caught sight of something crouching in a doorway. I made a step towards

            in the open here. Let's crawl into this doorway and talk. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Have you seen any . . . Martians? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Naah. They've gone over to New York. At night the sky is alive with
            their lights. Just as if people were still livin' in it. By daylight you can't see
            them.
            Five days ago a couple of them carried somethin' big across the flats from the airport.
            I
            believe they're learning how to fly. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Fly! 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Yeah, fly. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Then it's all over with humanity. Stranger, there's still you and I.
            Two of us left. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> They got themselves in solid; they wrecked the greatest country in
            the world. Those green stars, they're probably falling somewhere every night. They've
            only
            lost one machine. There isn't anything to do. We're done. We're licked. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Where were you? You're in a uniform. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Yeah, what's left of it. I was in the militia -- national guard. . .
            That's good! Wasn't any war any more than there's war between men and ants. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> And we're eat-able ants. I found that out. . . What will they do with
            us? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> I've thought it all out. Right now we're caught as we're wanted. The
            Martian only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run. But they won't keep
            doing
            that. They'll begin catching us systematic-like -- keeping the best and storing us
            in cages
            and things. They haven't begun on us yet! 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Not begun! 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Not begun! All that's happened so far is because we don't have sense
            enough to keep quiet. . . botherin' them with guns and such stuff and losing our heads
            and
            rushing off in crowds. Now instead of our rushing around blind we've got to fix ourselves
            up
            -- fix ourselves up according to the way things are NOW. Cities, nations, civilization,
            progress. . . done. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> But if that's so, what is there to live for? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Well, there won't be any more concerts for a million years or so,
            and no nice little dinners at restaurants. If it's amusement you're after, I guess
            the
            game's up. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> And what is there left? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Life. . . that's what! I want to live. Yeah, and so do you. We're
            not going to be exterminated. And I don't mean to be caught, either, and tamed, and
            fattened, and bred, like an ox. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> What are you going to do? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> I'm going on. . . right under their feet. I got a plan. We men as
            men are finished. We don't know enough. We gotta learn plenty before we've got a chance.
            And
            we've got to live and keep free while we learn, see? I've thought it all out, see.
            
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Tell me the rest. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Well, it isn't all of us that were made for wild beasts, and that's
            what it's got to be. That's why I watched YOU. All these little office workers that
            used to
            live in these houses -- they'd be no good. They haven't any stuff to 'em. They just
            used to
            run off to work. I've seen hundreds of 'em, running wild to catch their commuter train
            in
            the morning for fear they'd get canned if they didn't; running back at night afraid
            they
            won't be in time for dinner. Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.
            And
            on Sundays, worried about the hereafter. The Martians will be a godsend for those
            guys. Nice
            roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, no worries. After a week or so chasing about
            the
            fields on empty stomachs they'll come and be glad to be caught. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> You've thought it all out, haven't you? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> You bet I have! And that isn't all. These Martians will make pets of
            some of 'em, train 'em to do tricks. Who knows? Get sentimental over the pet boy who
            grew up
            and had to be killed. . . And some, maybe, they'll train to hunt us. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> No, that's impossible. No human being. . . 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Yes they will. There's men who'll do it gladly. If one of them ever
            comes after me, why. . . 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> In the meantime, you and I and others like us. . . where are we to
            live when the Martians own the earth? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> I've got it all figured out. We'll live underground. I've been
            thinking about the sewers. Under New York are miles and miles of 'em. The main ones
            are big
            enough for anybody. Then there's cellars, vaults, underground storerooms, railway
            tunnels,
            subways. You begin to see, eh? And we'll get a bunch of strong men together. No weak
            ones;
            that rubbish -- out. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> And you meant me to go? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> Well, I gave you a chance, didn't I? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> We won't quarrel about that. Go on. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> And we've got to make safe places for us to stay in, see, and get
            all the books we can -- science books. That's where men like you come in, see? We'll
            raid
            the museums, we'll even spy on the Martians. It may not be so much we have to learn
            before
            -- just imagine this: four or five of their own fighting machines suddenly start off
            -- heat
            rays right and left and not a Martian in 'em. Not a Martian in 'em! But MEN -- men
            who have
            learned the way how. It may even be in our time. Gee! Imagine having one of them lovely
            things with it's heat ray wide and free! We'd turn it on Martians, we'd turn it on
            men. We'd
            bring everybody down to their knees. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> That's your plan? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong> You, and me, and a few more of us we'd own the world. 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> I see. . . 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">STRANGER:</span></strong>
            **<span class="stageDirection">FADING OUT</span>** Say, what's the matter? . . . Where are you going? 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> Not to your world. . . Goodbye, stranger. . . 
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="speaker">PIERSON:</span></strong> After parting with the artilleryman, I came at last to the Holland
            Tunnel. I entered that silent tube anxious to know the fate of the great city on the
            other
            side of the Hudson. Cautiously I came out of the tunnel and made my way up Canal Street.
            I
            reached Fourteenth Street, and there again were black powder and several bodies, and
            an evil
            ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses. I wandered up
            through
            the Thirties and Forties; I stood alone on Times Square. I caught sight of a lean
            dog
            running down Seventh Avenue with a piece of dark brown meat in his jaws, and a pack
            of
            starving mongrels at his heels. He made a wide circle around me, as though he feared
            I might
            prove a fresh competitor. I walked up Broadway in the direction of that strange powder
            --
            past silent shopwindows, displaying their mute wares to empty sidewalks -- past the
            Capitol
            Theatre, silent, dark -- past a shooting gallery, where a row of empty guns faced
            an
            arrested line of wooden ducks. Near Columbus Circle I noticed models of 1939 motorcars
            in
            the showrooms facing empty streets. From over the top of the General Motors Building,
            I
            watched a flock of black birds circling in the sky. I hurried on. Suddenly I caught
            sight of
            the hood of a Martian machine, standing somewhere in Central Park, gleaming in the
            late
            afternoon sun. An insane idea! I rushed recklessly across Columbus Circle and into
            the Park.
            I climbed a small hill above the pond at Sixtieth Street. From there I could see,
            standing
            in a silent row along the mall, nineteen of those great metal Titans, their cowls
            empty,
            their great steel arms hanging listlessly by their sides. I looked in vain for the
            monsters
            that inhabit those machines. Suddenly, my eyes were attracted to the immense flock
            of black
            birds that hovered directly below me. They circled to the ground, and there before
            my eyes,
            stark and silent, lay the Martians, with the hungry birds pecking and tearing brown
            shreds
            of flesh from their dead bodies. Later when their bodies were examined in the laboratories,
            it was found that they were killed by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against
            which
            their systems were unprepared. . . slain, after all man's defenses had failed, by
            the
            humblest thing that God in His wisdom put upon this earth. Before the cylinder fell
            there
            was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond
            the petty
            surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. Dim and wonderful is the vision
            I have
            conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seedbed of the solar
            system
            throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a remote dream. It
            may be
            that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, is
            the
            future ordained perhaps. Strange it now seems to sit in my peaceful study at Princeton
            writing down this last chapter of the record begun at a deserted farm in Grovers Mill.
            Strange to see from my window the university spires dim and blue through an April
            haze.
            Strange to watch children playing in the streets. Strange to see young people strolling
            on
            the green, where the new spring grass heals the last black scars of a bruised earth.
            Strange
            to watch the sightseers enter the museum where the dissembled parts of a Martian machine
            are
            kept on public view. Strange when I recall the time when I first saw it, bright and
            clean-cut, hard, and silent, under the dawn of that last great day. **<span class="stageDirection">MUSIC SWELLS UP AND
