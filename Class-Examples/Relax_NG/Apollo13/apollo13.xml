                <transmission MET="055:48:46" com="CC">- - we'd like you to roll right to 060 and
                        null your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett. To do that, we would
                        like you to enable quads C and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads. And
                        in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on
                        battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify -
                        -</transmission>

                        your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what
                                <panel>SERVO</panel>, and what beam width.</transmission>
                <transmission MET="055:49:25" com="CMP">Okay, Jack, during the TV, we were

                                <panel>PRIMARY ELECTRONICS</panel>. And we had a good lockup. Just
                        after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good
                        signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in
                        yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero
                        and pitch would go to 90.</transmission>

                        of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd like to know it that's 2.0
                        precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.</transmission>
