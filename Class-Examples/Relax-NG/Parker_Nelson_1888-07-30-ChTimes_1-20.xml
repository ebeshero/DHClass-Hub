                    <p>The <seg><w type="adj" ana="next">next</w> <w type="noun">morning</w></seg> I resumed the <w type="noun">rags</w> of <w type="noun">poverty</w> and at 7 o'clock made my debut as the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">factory hand</w>. I was one of <seg><w type="adj" ana="120">120</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w></seg>, ranging in age from 15 to 60. The <w type="noun">factory</w> where the <seg><w type="adj" ana="never-rip">never-rip</w> <w type="noun">jerseys</w></seg> are made is at the <placeName type="locRef">corner of Washington and Union streets</placeName>, with the <seg><w type="adj" ana="elevator">elevator</w> <w type="noun">entrance</w></seg> in the rear and <w type="noun">workroom</w> on the <seg><w type="adj" ana="5">fifth</w> <w type="noun">story</w></seg>.</p>
                    <p>The <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> began to arrive at 7 o'clock, and at every trip of the <w type="noun">elevator</w> some twenty or more were carried up-stairs. I took a <w type="noun">chair</w> in one of the <seg><w type="adj" ana="machine">machine</w> <w type="noun">rows</w></seg>, and for an hour did nothing but watch the preparations for work in that <seg><w type="adj" ana="human">human</w> <w type="noun">hive</w></seg>. The <w type="noun">room</w> was 50x138, with an <seg><w type="adj" ana="open">open</w> <w type="adj" ana="unfinished">unfinished</w> <w type="noun">roof</w></seg> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="brick">brick</w> <w type="noun">walls</w> <w type="adj" ana="calcimined">calcimined</w></seg>. <w type="noun">Light</w> was admitted from <seg><w type="adj" ana="rear">rear</w> and <w type="adj" ana="side">side</w> <w type="noun">windows</w></seg>. The <w type="noun" ana="#employee">pressmen</w> had their <w type="noun">boards</w> and <w type="noun">furnaces</w> at the south end of the <w type="noun">room</w>, where all the <w type="noun">work</w> was pressed prior to being boxed and ticketed for the <w type="noun">trade</w>. At the extreme opposite end was the <w type="noun">cutting-room</w>, fenced in from the rest, and between the two were the <w type="noun">worktables</w>, where the hundred odd <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> stitched and finished the <w type="noun">jerseys</w>.</p>
                    <p>Along the <seg><w type="adj" ana="brick">brick</w> <w type="noun">walls</w></seg> were <w type="noun">nails</w>, irregularly driven, on which the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> hung their <w type="noun">hats</w> and <w type="noun">wraps</w>, <w type="noun">dresses</w> and <w type="noun">collars</w>. Nearly every one took off her <w type="noun">dress</w> and <w type="noun">waist</w>, turned it inside out, put it on a <w type="noun">nail</w> and put on a calico of old stuff shop suit. A few took off their <w type="noun">corsets</w> and nearly all the <seg><w type="adj" ana="machine">machine</w> <w type="noun" ana="#employee">hands</w></seg> changed their <w type="noun">shoes</w> before <w type="noun">work</w>. On the stroke of 7:30 a <w type="noun">bell</w> rang, the <w type="noun">power</w> was turned on the <!-- describing mackines do we seg this --><w type="noun">machines</w> began to buzz like <seg><w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="noun">saw-mills</w></seg> and the day's work had commenced. <seg><w type="noun">Heads</w> of <w type="adj" ana="brown">brown</w>, <w type="adj" ana="black">black</w>, <w type="adj" ana="yellow">yellow</w>, and <w type="adj" ana="gray">gray</w></seg> bent so near the <seg><w type="adj" ana="flying">flying</w> <w type="noun">shuttles</w></seg> that every minute I experted the <w type="noun">bangs</w> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="fluffy">fluffy</w> <w type="noun">crimps</w></seg> would get caught in the <w type="noun">machinery</w>. The <w type="noun">faces</w> were <w type="adj" ana="sad">sad</w> and so very, very pales that I shall never look at a <w type="noun">jersey</w> again without seeing them. The <seg><w type="adj" ana="average">average</w> <w type="noun">age</w></seg> may have been 23, but not less. There were <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> of 17 and 18 and some <seg><w type="adj" ana="world-weary">world-weary</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w></seg> past 50 all working for little more than enough to keep <w type="noun">body</w> and <w type="noun">soul</w> together. The <w type="noun">work</w> circulated in <w type="noun">baskets</w>-<seg><w type="adj" ana="long">long</w> <w type="adj" ana="chip">chip</w> <w type="noun">hampers</w></seg> with stout-handles-that held a dozen, with room for five times that quantity. A great deal of time was lost by the <w type="noun" ana="#employee">workers</w> in getting the <w type="noun">contents</w> of the <w type="noun">basket</w> examined, checked off on the <w type="noun">ticket</w> and the <w type="noun">ticket</w> stamped. If it had been the last change for <w type="noun">life</w> I don't believe the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> would have worked any harder for <w type="noun">salvation</w>. Scarcely a <w type="noun">head</w> was raised from <w type="noun">machine</w> or <w type="noun">lap</w>. <w type="noun">Shoulders</w> were bent down, <w type="noun">chests</w> hollowed in, and faces drooped so low that I could not begin to make a study of the "windows of the souls" before me. At 8:40 the proprietor of the chair I was in asked me to vacate, and I walked down through the <seg><w type="adj" ana="narrow">narrow</w> <w type="noun">aisles</w></seg> of <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">sewing-women</w> to the "<w type="noun" ana="#foreperson">forelady</w>" and asked for <w type="noun">work</w>.</p>
                    <p>She asked me if I wanted to take a <w type="noun">machine</w>, but I expressed a preference for finishing. I was given a <w type="noun">number</w>, a <w type="noun">basket</w> with five <w type="noun">jerseys</w> to finish, and a <w type="noun">chair</w> beside a <w type="noun">girl</w> named <persName>Hannah</persName>, who, being engaged by the way was told to "<said who="#foreperson" ana="female">show me.</said>" <persName>Hannah</persName> had <seg><w type="adj" ana="blonde">blonde</w> <w type="noun">hair</w></seg> and talked with the brogue. She gave me a <w type="noun">needle</w> as long as my <seg><w type="adj" ana="engagement">engagement</w> <w type="noun">finger</w></seg>, and the <seg><w type="adj" ana="meager">most meager</w> <w type="noun">instruction</w></seg> compatible with obedience. Fortunately I had my <w type="noun">thimble</w> and crossing my <w type="noun">knees</w> I threaded the <seg><w type="adj" ana="gimlet-like">gimlet-like</w> <w type="noun">needle</w></seg> with <w type="noun">silk</w> and I proceeded to hook-and-eye a <w type="noun">jersey</w>. Remembering the <w type="adj" ana="treachery">treachery</w> of my <seg><w type="adj" ana="shop">shop</w> <w type="noun">clothes</w></seg> I ever wore filled the two <w type="noun">hooks and eyes</w> with sewing and after testing them proceeded to face the <w type="noun">collar</w>. I told <persName>Hannah</persName> about my <w type="noun">misery</w>, but she wisely said it was no fault of hers and went on with a $3-a-dozen <w type="noun">lot</w> she had been doing two days and a half. Thinking it would be a good way to get acquainted with my <w type="noun">neighbors</w> I asked several for a <seg><w type="adj" ana="fine">fine</w> <w type="noun">needle</w></seg> and at last exchanged the <w type="noun">crow-bar</w> <persName>Hannah</persName> had given me for a line cambric <w type="noun">article</w>. It worked better and at the end of two hours I had bound the <w type="noun">arm-holes</w>, faced the <w type="noun">collar</w>, tacked the front <w type="noun">facing</w> and the bustle piece, and put two patts of hooks and eyes in a <seg><w type="adj" ana="black">black</w> <w type="noun">jersey</w></seg>. The <w type="noun">dye</w> was not fast, neither was the <w type="noun">wool</w>, for my <w type="noun">throat</w>, <w type="noun">ears</w>, and <w type="noun">nostrils</w> were tufted with <seg><w type="adj" ana="black">black</w> <w type="noun">lint</w></seg>. I was African from the <w type="noun">nails</w> to the <w type="noun">wrists</w>. The front <w type="noun">facings</w> had to be trimmed off. I had no <w type="noun">scissors</w>. <persName>Hannah</persName> was ungenerous with hers, and I lost about 15 cents worth of time borrowing the <w type="noun">weapons</w>. At noon I had finished four <w type="noun">jerseys</w> and was so sore about the <w type="noun">neck</w> and <w type="noun">back</w> that I could scarcely rise from the <w type="noun">chair</w>. I began to scent <seg><w type="adj" ana="hot">hot</w> <w type="noun">tea</w></seg>, and looking about saw a <seg><w type="adj" ana="big">big</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girl</w></seg> called <persName>Emma</persName> brewing three <w type="noun">pots</w> of Japan over one of the press <w type="noun">furnaces</w>. She had her <seg><w type="adj" ana="front">front</w> <w type="noun">hair</w></seg> in <seg><w type="adj" ana="curl">curl</w> <w type="noun">papers</w></seg> and was whistling "In The Sweet Bye and Bye." About thirty <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> went to her, each with her own <w type="noun">cup</w>, for a supply of <w type="noun">tea</w>. I remarked to one passing my <w type="noun">chair</w> that her <w type="noun">tea</w> looked awfully nice<!-- describing the tea sooo what do we do here --> and asked where she got it.</p>
                    <p>"<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">From <persName>Em</persName>. She makes it and we each pay 2 cents a <w type="noun">week</w>.</said>"</p>
                    <p>On the stroke of 12 the <w type="noun">machines</w> stopped and 120 <seg><w type="adj" ana="tired">tired</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w></seg> stopped too, for thirty minutes' rest and the <w type="noun">food</w> that could hardly be called refreshing. In the main it consisted of <seg><w type="adj" ana="brown">brown</w> <w type="noun">bread</w></seg> and <w type="noun">butter</w>. In some <w type="noun">parcels</w> there was <seg><w type="adj" ana="cold">cold</w> <w type="noun">meat</w></seg> and <w type="noun">cake</w>: others had <w type="noun">pie</w>; a few a <w type="noun">bottle</w> or <w type="noun">canteen</w> of <w type="noun">milk</w>, <seg><w type="adj" ana="cold">cold</w> <w type="noun">tea</w></seg> or <w type="noun">coffee</w>, but I did not see a particle of <w type="noun">fruit</w>. One <seg><w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girl</w></seg> who had been stretching <w type="noun">jerseys</w> at 2 cents each made a <w type="noun">lunch</w> on three graham <w type="noun">crackers</w> and a piece of <seg><w type="adj" ana="custard">custard</w> <w type="noun">pie</w></seg>, which she ate reading a <seg><w type="adj" ana="paper-covered">paper-covered</w> <w type="noun">book</w></seg>. I counted thirty-seven <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> with a <w type="noun">lunch</w> of <seg><w type="adj" ana="dry">dry</w> <w type="noun">bread</w></seg>, fifteen with <w type="noun">sandwiches</w>, and ten who ate <seg><w type="adj" ana="cold">cold</w> <w type="noun">pancakes</w></seg>. Twenty-three <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> were without any <w type="noun">luncheon</w> whatever. During the <w type="noun">intermission</w> the <w type="noun">elevator</w> stopped running and no one left the <w type="noun">building</w> but myself. Less than ten minutes was spent over the <seg><w type="adj" ana="wretched">wretched</w> <w type="noun">meal</w></seg>. At one side of the west <w type="noun">wall</w>, separated by a <seg><w type="adj" ana="ten-foot">ten-foot</w> <w type="adj" ana="pine">pine</w> <w type="noun">partition</w></seg>, was the toilet-room containing an <w type="adj" ana="iron">iron</w> <choice><sic>zinc</sic><reg resp="#rjp">sink</reg></choice> with one <w type="noun">faucet</w> of <seg><w type="adj" ana="running">running</w> <w type="noun">water</w></seg>. Here the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> crowded like so many <w type="noun">cattle</w>, each with her bit of <w type="noun">soap</w> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="grimy">grimy</w> <w type="adj" ana="cotton">cotton</w> <w type="noun">towel</w></seg>, to wash. Dress <w type="noun">waists</w> were loosened and <w type="noun">necks</w>, <w type="noun">faces</w>, <w type="noun">arms</w>, and <w type="noun">hands</w> lathered with <w type="noun">soap</w> and rinsed, as the change permitted. There were three <seg><w type="noun">closets</w>, <w type="adj" ana="unflushed">unflushed</w>, <w type="adj" ana="untidy">untidy</w>, and <w type="adj" ana="unwholesome">unwholesome</w></seg>. Set up against the <w type="noun">wall</w> in this <w type="noun">enclosure</w>, with the <w type="noun">faucet</w> run through the <w type="noun">partition</w>, was a <w type="noun">barrel</w> of <seg><w type="adj" ana="ice">ice</w> <w type="noun">water</w></seg> inscribed in <seg><w type="adj" ana="big">big</w> <w type="noun">letters</w></seg>:</p>
                        <p>"Two cents will be collected every <w type="noun">Saturday</w> for <seg><w type="adj" ana="ice">ice</w> <w type="noun">water</w></seg>."</p>
                        <p>Besides this <w type="noun">luxury</w> every <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">hand</w> pays 12 cents a <w type="noun">week</w> for the use of the <w type="noun">machine</w>.</p>
                    <p>At 1 o'clock I finished my <w type="noun">basket</w>, which I dragged to <persName>Tom</persName>, the <w type="noun" ana="#employee">book-keeper</w>, who took my <w type="noun">name</w> and credited me with five <w type="noun">garments</w>. No <w type="noun">price</w> had been put on the <w type="noun">jerseys</w>, as they were <seg><w type="adj" ana="sampled">sampled</w> <w type="noun">goods</w></seg>, but the <w type="noun" ana="#foreperson">forelady</w> thought they would go at 60 cents a dozen, which meant 25 cents to my <w type="noun">credit</w>.</p>
                    <p>I didn't get any more work till 2 o'clock because the <w type="noun" ana="#foreperson">forelady</w> was in the <w type="noun">toilet-room</w> having her <w type="noun">bangs</w> done up in <w type="noun">paper</w>. She was a <seg><w type="adj" ana="pretty">pretty</w> <w type="noun" ana="#foreperson">woman</w></seg>, by the way, with a <seg><w type="adj" ana="good">good</w> <w type="noun">face</w></seg> and a shock of <seg><w type="adj" ana="beautiful">beautiful</w> <w type="adj" ana="auburn">auburn</w> <w type="noun">hair</w></seg>. She had been in her <w type="noun">position</w> for six <w type="noun">years</w> and was drawing a <w type="noun">salary</w> of $35 a <w type="noun">week</w>. The <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> had a <seg><w type="adj" ana="good">good</w> <w type="noun">word</w></seg> for her generally, but she struck me as being a <w type="noun" ana="#foreperson">woman</w> without <w type="noun">heart</w>. At her <w type="noun">appearance</w> I was given a basketful of <w type="noun">jerseys</w> to finish <w type="noun">button-holes</w>. I worked like a <w type="noun">Trojan</w> for an hour, at the end of which I won the heart of a <seg><w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girl</w></seg> who sat at the end of my <w type="noun">table</w> facing the <w type="noun">wall</w>. She had been sitting still so long that I called out and asked if she were ill.</p>
                    <p>"<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">No. I haven't any <w type="noun">work</w>.</said>"</p>
                    <p>Tired almost to exhaustion and as hot as a newly-built mustard plaster I was only too glad of a chance to transfer my <w type="noun">interests</w>, but she declined. It was too hot to work; she was going away soon, she said, and didn't care to do any more.</p>
                    <p>"<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">When did I begin? <w type="noun">Today</w>. I worked in a <w type="noun">box-factory</w>, but it was so dull I could only earn 16 cents a day. My <w type="noun">mother</w> wants me to pay her $2.50 a week board, but how could I with 96 cents. This is no better. I came at 8 this morning and I have only made 11 cents. I am 21. <w type="noun">Beaus</w>? Yes, some. I have one <seg><w type="adj" ana="steady">steady</w> <w type="noun">fellow</w></seg>, but I don't know if he will marry me. I hope he will.</said> She told me he earned $75 a month as a telegraph <w type="noun">operator</w> on the board of trade; that he was "<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">steady as a steeple, and the only <w type="noun">fellow</w> she ever loved.</said>"</p>
                    <p>I told her how to go about catching the <seg><w type="adj" ana="prosperous">prosperous</w> <w type="noun">telegrapher</w></seg> and rehashed a <w type="noun">recipe</w> given me by no less a personage than <persName>Mrs. John M.

She was going to a <w type="noun">picnic</w> at <placeName type="locRef">Garfield park</placeName> at 6 o'clock and brought over a 25-cent chocolate <w type="noun">cake</w> to show me. Then she loaned me her <w type="noun">scissors</w>, told me <choice><sic>good-by</sic><reg resp="#rjp">good-bye</reg></choice>, and went <w type="noun">home</w> to dress for the <w type="noun">fete</w>.</p> 
                    <p>Nothing of any importance occurred till someone passed the news that a <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girl</w> was asleep in the <w type="noun">closet</w>. Half a dozen left their <w type="noun">machines</w> to look at her, <persName>Hannah</persName>, my <w type="noun">mentor</w>, among them.</p>
                    <p>"<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">Oh, you just ought to see her, fast asleep, with her <seg><w type="noun">mouth</w> <!-- whats the stem here? --><w type="adj" ana="open">wide open</w></seg>.</said>" It was more than I could stand. I threw my <w type="noun">button-holes</w> into the <w type="noun">basket</w> and went to the <w type="noun">toiletroom</w>. Sure enough, there was the <seg><w type="adj" ana="poor">poor</w> <w type="noun">girl</w></seg> sitting in the <seg><w type="adj" ana="dirty">dirty</w> <w type="noun">place</w></seg>, her <w type="noun">head</w> resting against a <seg><w type="adj" ana="folded">folded</w> <w type="noun">apron</w></seg>, breathing in the <seg><w type="adj" ana="foul">foul</w> <w type="noun">air</w></seg> that reeked with <w type="noun">filth</w> and <w type="noun">disease</w>. The <w type="noun">walls</w> of the <w type="noun">closet</w> were <w type="adj" ana="black">black</w> with pencil <w type="noun">marks</w>, the <w type="noun">floor</w> was strewn with <w type="noun">lint</w> and <w type="noun">threads</w>, and the <seg><w type="adj" ana="pale">pale</w> <w type="noun">face</w></seg> of the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">sleeper</w> looked <w type="adj" ana="ghastly">ghastly</w> in the darkness. She had tied one end of a <w type="noun">string</w> to the <w type="noun">latch</w> and the other to the drop chain.</p>
                    <p>"<said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">My dear <w type="noun">child</w>, musnt't sleep here. Are you sick?</said>"</p>
                    <p>"<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">Oh, I am so sick.</said>"</p>
                    <p>Instantly there were a dozen <seg><w type="adj" ana="willing">willing</w> <w type="noun" ana="#employee">hands</w></seg> to help her out to a <w type="noun">window</w> where a <w type="noun">chair</w> was placed for her. We rubbed her <w type="noun">temples</w>, chafed her <w type="noun">hands</w>, bathed her <w type="noun">head</w>, and got her some <w type="noun">lemons</w>. After making her <w type="noun">toilet</w> she came over to my <w type="noun">table</w> as I sewed away at my <w type="noun">button-holes</w> she told me her <w type="noun">story</w>.</p>
                    <p>"<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female"><persName>Rose</persName> and I are only six <w type="noun">months</w> in this <w type="noun">country</w>. We came from <placeName type="country">England</placeName> with our brother and live on <placeName type="locRef">Carpenter street</placeName>. The <w type="noun">climate</w> doesn't agree with me and I am sick all the time. At first we worked in <orgName ref="#MarshF" type="exposedCompany">Marshall Field's</orgName> and <persName>Rose</persName> and I made <w type="noun">fringe</w>. We got $7 a <w type="noun">week</w> and were so happy. It was awful nice there. We didn't have to pay for <seg><w type="adj" ana="drinking">drinking</w> <w type="noun">water</w></seg> or anything; there were lots of <w type="noun">towels</w>, whole cakes of <w type="noun">soap</w>, and oh, it was so clean. We had a <w type="noun">foreperson</w> over us and he was as good as a <w type="noun">brother</w> to us. Sometimes we let our <w type="noun">money</w> lay and drew it in a <w type="noun">pile</w>; oh, such a lot as it was! We put away very much of it. But I got sick and all we 'ad saved went for <w type="noun">doctor</w> and <w type="noun">medicine</w>. Then the <w type="noun">work</w> stopped. They took our <w type="noun">names</w> though and promised to send for us in the <w type="noun">fall</w>. For a while we worked in the <seg><w type="adj" ana="box">box</w> <w type="noun">factory</w></seg>, but liked to starve. Then we went to <orgName ref="#Ellinger" type="exposedCompany">Ellinger's</orgName> and made <w type="noun">cloaks</w> at 30 cents each, but it was so hard, and we couldn't please them no matter how we tried. We came here today, but it's only a fit place to starve in. All the <w type="noun">work</w> they gave me was a dozen <w type="noun">jerseys</w> to button; that's 11 cents a row; had two dozen <w type="noun">holes</w> to finish at 16 cents. Twenty-seven cents for the two of us! How can we live on it?</said>" and the <w type="noun">child</w> began to cry again.</p>
                    <p>By way of comforting her I took her <w type="noun">name</w>, promised to help her, and gave her my <w type="noun">check</w> for 41 cents. She didn't think it would be honored so I took it to the <w type="noun" ana="#employee">cashier</w> myself and demanded pay as I was not coming back in the <w type="noun">morning</w>. "<said who="#employee" ana="male">No, ma'am,</said>" said <persName>Tom</persName>, "<said who="#employee" ana="male">you don't get it. Come round on the 20th and I hunt you up.</said>"</p>
                    <p>At 5:30 work ceased. Each <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girl</w> had to sweep out her <w type="noun">place</w>, clean and oil the <w type="noun">machine</w>, and return her <w type="noun">basket</w> and <w type="noun">check</w>. I paid a <w type="noun">nickel</w> to have my <w type="noun">corner</w> swept, and finding it impossible to wash up sans <w type="noun">towel</w> and <w type="noun">soap</w> I got under my <w type="noun">veil</w> and rang the <w type="noun">elevator</w>. The <w type="noun" ana="#employee">pressers</w> laughed and told me to try the <w type="noun">stairs</w> - five <w type="noun">flights</w>. Down I went. At the second I went into the <w type="noun">salesroom</w> to buy a <w type="noun">jersey</w>. One of the <w type="noun" ana="#NRJC">firm</w> waited on me; his magnanimity was sublime. The <seg><w type="adj" ana="identical">identical</w> <w type="adj" ana="black">black</w> <w type="noun">jersey</w></seg> that I had received 5 cents for finishing was offered to me at $2. I declined. By way of interest, one hundred dozen <w type="noun">garments</w> are turned out of the <w type="noun" ana="#NRJC">factory</w> every day in the year. As near as I could learn the <w type="noun">salaries</w> average $4 a week, but plenty of <seg><w type="adj" ana="grown">grown</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w></seg> are not allowed to earn over 28 cents a day.</p>
                    <p><w type="noun">Work</w> begins at 7:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Anyone five minutes late working on time is fined an hour's pay, and for the loss of an hour the pay of half a day is knocked off. <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">Piece-workers</w> who are late are kept idle form one to three hours. A <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girl</w> who loses her <w type="noun">ticket</w> forfeits pay for the entire work, not withstanding the entry is on the <w type="noun">books</w> of the <w type="noun" ana="#NRJC">firm</w>.</p>

                    <head>LIFE AMONG THE SLAVE GIRLS OF <placeName type="city">CHICAGO</placeName>.</head>
                    <p>THE TIMES Will print tomorrow the second batch of facts concerning the workings of some of the factories of <placeName type="city">Chicago</placeName> where girls and women are employed. These articles are written by a young lady who passed through the common experiences of those unfortunates of her own sex who are compelled to undergo the hardships and tortures of factory life in this city. She tells plainly what she saw and what she heard; gives names and places whenever necessary, and backs up her statements with unquestionable proofs.</p>
                    <p>These are revelations as unexpected as they are unpleasant. It was necessary that The Times should make them in order that the unthinking wealthy, well-to-do, and comfortable citizens of <placeName type="city">Chicago</placeName> should have their eyes opened.</p>
                    <p>If the condition of the working women and girls of this city is improved, even in a slight degree, by these exposures The Times will be fully repaid.</p>
                    <p>Read The Times every day this week. Two cents per copy. Delivered by carrier, 12 cents per week for daily and 15 cents per week for daily and Sunday. Order it by postal card, letter, or telephone 1362.</p>
