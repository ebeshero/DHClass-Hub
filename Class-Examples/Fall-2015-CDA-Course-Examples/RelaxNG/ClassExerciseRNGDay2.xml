 <introduction addressee="Bunny" aka="David_Garnett">Dear Bunny,</introduction>
 <body>
  <txt paragraph="first">I write from this doomed city and I have great doubts that this will reach
   you. We had arranged, before this horror [The General Strike], to stay with <name>Dadie</name> at
    <location>Cambridge</location> on the <time date="1926-05-21">21st</time>—God knows what will
   have happened by then. But let us come later, if its possible. We very much want to.</txt>

  <txt paragraph="second">There has been such confusion here <situation>(all helpers in the Press
    fled)</situation> that we couldn't send you <name>Viola</name> [Tree's Castles in the Air]; now
   parcels aren't taken. But we will send directly it is possible again:</txt>

  <txt paragraph="third">Well—I like <animal type="snakes"/>: so far as human feelings are left me.
   After <time>2 days</time> of worrying and doing nothing, and talking and listening in, one is
   scarcely a <animal type="worm"/>, let alone a<animal type="bird"/>. <question>What happens to you
    in the country?</question></txt>
