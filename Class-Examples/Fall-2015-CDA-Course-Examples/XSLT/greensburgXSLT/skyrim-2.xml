        This is yet another Skyrim book. I like them. I picked this book because, as a player, 
        I really truly enjoyed it. Most players of Oblivion (Skyrim's predecessor, which occurred 
        in the same world, but 200 years earlier) would; it actually recaps the main quest of the 
        previous game, from the perspective of a historian. The nature of Bethesda games allows 
        for a great amount of player freedom, and so some details of this book could be correct 
        for how one player experienced it, but completely inaccurate when describing another 
        player's game. This is why the hero's alignment and loyalty is left neutral; many players 
        choose to be evil, and may have ignored the main quest entirely. For this markup, I chose 
        to highlight all the events in the main quest which would stick out to an Oblivion player 
        interested to see how his hero's saga has been told. -->

        <subtitle>A summary of the events stemming from <QuestEvent>the assassination of <character
                    ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</character></QuestEvent></subtitle>
    </cover>
    <body>
        <paragraph>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, <QuestEvent>the <character
                    ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</character> was
                assassinated</QuestEvent> and <QuestEvent>the <QuestItem>Amulet of Kings</QuestItem>
                was destroyed</QuestEvent>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
            down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><QuestEvent>The <faction ref="MythicDawn">assassins</faction> first attacked the
                    <character ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</character></QuestEvent> in the
                <location>White Gold Tower</location>. While the <faction ref="blades"
                >Blades</faction> held <faction ref="MythicDawn">them</faction> back,
                <QuestEvent>the <character ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</character> made <character
                    ref="UrielSeptim">his</character> way down to the
                <location>dungeons</location></QuestEvent>, to a <location>secret escape
                route</location> built into <location>one of the prison cells</location>. For
            reasons known only to <character ref="UrielSeptim">himself</character>, the <character
                ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</character>
            <QuestEvent>pardoned the fortunate <character ref="hero"
                >prisoner</character></QuestEvent> in that <location>cell</location>. Some say the
                <character ref="hero">prisoner</character> reminded <character ref="UrielSeptim"
                >him</character> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a <QuestEvent>moment of
                prophecy</QuestEvent>. Whatever the case, the <character ref="hero"
                >prisoner</character> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
                <location>Empire</location> and <location>Tamriel</location> - surely a sign that
            the gods themselves were at work.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The pursuing <QuestEvent><faction ref="MythicDawn">assassins</faction> killed the
                    <faction ref="blades">Blades</faction> bodyguards</QuestEvent> in a relentless
            series of sneak attacks. Eventually <QuestEvent><faction ref="MythicDawn">they</faction>
                struck down the <character ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</character>
                <character ref="UrielSeptim">himself</character></QuestEvent>. Before <character
                ref="UrielSeptim">he</character> fell, <QuestEvent><character ref="UrielSeptim"
                    >Uriel Septim VII</character> gave the <QuestItem>Amulet of Kings</QuestItem> to
                the <character ref="hero">prisoner</character></QuestEvent>, who somehow
                <QuestEvent>made it out of the <location>Imperial sewers</location></QuestEvent> and
            into the light of day.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of <faction
                ref="MythicDawn">daedric cultists</faction> known as the <faction ref="MythicDawn"
                >Mythic Dawn</faction>. (Those who still suspect the <faction ref="DarkBrotherhood"
                >Dark Brotherhood</faction> should consider two facts: first, they would have only
            needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the <faction
                ref="DarkBrotherhood">Dark Brotherhood</faction> would never be so foolish as to
                <QuestEvent>effectively declare war on the Empire</QuestEvent> and thus ensure their
            complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the <faction ref="MythicDawn">Mythic
                Dawn</faction>.)</paragraph>

        <!---A small note about the inclusion of an effective declaration of war on the Empire as a quest event: in Skyrim, the main quest for the Dark Brotherhood is to assassinate the Emperor of Tamriel. This amused me, so I included it.-->

        <paragraph>The <QuestItem>Amulet of Kings</QuestItem> next surfaced at <location>Weynon
                Priory</location> near <location type="city">Chorrol</location>. <character
                ref="Jauffre">Jauffre</character>, secret <epithet ref="Jauffre">Grandmaster of the
                    <faction ref="blades">Blades</faction></epithet> and head of the
                <location>priory</location>, <QuestEvent>took possession of the
                    <QuestItem>amulet</QuestItem></QuestEvent>. <QuestEvent>The <character
                    ref="hero">messenger</character> was sent off to <location type="city"
                    >Kvatch</location></QuestEvent> to find a lowly <character ref="MartinSeptim"
                >priest</character> named <character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character>.
            Unbeknownst even to <character ref="MartinSeptim">himself</character>, <character
                ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character> was the bastard son of <character
                ref="UrielSeptim">Uriel Septim VII</character>, and the last heir to the Ruby
            Throne. <character ref="MartinSeptim">He</character> alone could use the
                <QuestItem>Amulet of Kings</QuestItem> to light the Dragonfires that wards the
            barrier between <location>Tamriel</location> and <location>Oblivion</location>, and save
            the world from the <faction ref="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</faction> plot.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><QuestEvent>The <character ref="hero">prisoner</character> arrived at <location
                    type="city">Kvatch</location></QuestEvent> to find <location type="city"
                >it</location> overrun by <faction ref="daedra">daedra</faction> that had poured in
            from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of the
            Oblivion Crisis. How <QuestEvent>the <character ref="hero">prisoner</character> closed
                the gate</QuestEvent> is not recorded. Once closed, <character ref="MartinSeptim"
                >Martin</character> and the surviving <location type="city">Kvatch</location>
            <faction ref="empire">guardsmen</faction> drove back the <faction ref="daedra"
                >daedra</faction>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Now known as the <epithet ref="hero">Hero of <location type="city"
                    >Kvatch</location></epithet>, <QuestEvent>the <character ref="hero"
                    >prisoner</character> and <character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character>
                returned to <location>Weynon Priory</location></QuestEvent>, only to find the
                <location>priory</location> sacked and the <QuestItem>Amulet</QuestItem> taken.
                <character ref="Jauffre">Jauffre</character> survived the attack, however, and
                <QuestEvent>the <character ref="hero Jauffre MartinSeptim">three of them</character>
                made their way to <location>Cloud Ruler Temple</location></QuestEvent>, bastion of
            the <faction ref="blades">Blades</faction>. This secret <location>fortress</location> in
            the <location>mountains</location> outside <location type="city">Bruma</location> is
            where <character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character> was held safe while
                <QuestEvent>the <epithet ref="hero">Hero of <location type="city"
                    >Kvatch</location></epithet> searched for the lost
                <QuestItem>Amulet</QuestItem></QuestEvent>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Knowing only that a mysterious group called the <faction ref="MythicDawn">Mythic
                Dawn</faction> was behind the <QuestEvent>assassination and theft of the
                    <QuestItem>Amulet</QuestItem></QuestEvent>, <QuestEvent>the <epithet ref="hero"
                    >Hero of <location type="city">Kvatch</location></epithet> was sent to locate
                the <faction ref="MythicDawn">cult</faction></QuestEvent>. With the help of
                <character>Baurus</character>, a <faction ref="blades">Blade</faction> in the
            service of the <character ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</character>, <character
                ref="MartinSeptim hero Jauffre">they</character> somehow <QuestEvent>used the
                    <QuestItem>Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes</QuestItem></QuestEvent>,
            esoteric works by the madman <character ref="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</character>,
            to direct <character ref="MartinSeptim hero Jauffre">them</character> to the <faction
                ref="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</faction>'s secret <location>lair</location>. Scholars
            familiar with the <QuestItem>Commentaries</QuestItem> claim the location is not directly
            mentioned in <QuestItem>them</QuestItem>. How <character ref="MartinSeptim hero Jauffre"
                >they</character> did this remains a mystery.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>No official records exist of how <QuestEvent>the <epithet ref="hero">Hero of
                        <location type="city">Kvatch</location></epithet> penetrated the <faction
                    ref="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</faction>'s <location>lair</location></QuestEvent>
            near <location>Lake Arrius</location>. There is a bardic tale that claims the <character
                ref="hero">Hero</character> used <QuestEvent>trickery and disguise</QuestEvent>, but
            that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <character
                ref="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</character> was behind the <faction
                ref="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</faction>, and that the <faction ref="MythicDawn"
                >group</faction> worshiped the daedric prince <character ref="MehrunesDagon"
                >Mehrunes Dagon</character>. <character ref="MankarCamoran">Mankar
                Camoran</character> believed <character ref="MankarCamoran">himself</character> to
            be a direct descendant of the <character>Camoran Usurper</character>, the infamous
            pretender to the throne of <location>Valenwood</location>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Somehow <QuestEvent>the <character ref="hero">Hero</character> escaped with the
                    <QuestItem>Mysterium Xarxes itself</QuestItem></QuestEvent>, the holy book of
            the <faction ref="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn cult</faction>. <character ref="MankarCamoran"
                >Mankar Camoran</character> fled to <location>Oblivion</location> with the
                <QuestItem>Amulet of Kings</QuestItem>. With some effort and great risk to
                <character ref="MartinSeptim">his</character> sanity, <QuestEvent><character
                    ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character> deciphered the Mysterium
                Xarxes</QuestEvent> and intended to use <QuestItem>it</QuestItem> to open a gateway
            to <character ref="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</character> in order to recover the
                <QuestItem>Amulet of Kings</QuestItem>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Before <character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character> could perform the ritual
            to open the gateway, <QuestEvent><character ref="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes
                    Dagon</character> opened an Oblivion Gate outside <location type="city"
                    >Bruma</location></QuestEvent>. <QuestEvent>The <epithet ref="hero">Hero of
                        <location type="city">Kvatch</location></epithet> saved the <location
                    type="city">city</location> and <character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character>
                by entering the gate and closing it</QuestEvent> before a <faction ref="daedra"
                >daedric siege engine</faction> could destroy <location type="city">Bruma</location>
            and <location>Cloud Ruler Temple</location>. Many songs and stories have been told of
            this battle and I will not retell them here. The <epithet ref="hero">Hero of <location
                    type="city">Kvatch</location></epithet> was now also known as the <epithet
                ref="hero">Savior of <location type="city">Bruma</location></epithet>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>With the <location type="city">city</location> and <location>Cloud Ruler
                Temple</location> safe, <QuestEvent><character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character>
                opened the portal to <character ref="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</character>'s
                    "<location>Paradise</location>"</QuestEvent>. The details of what transpired in
            this <location>place</location> have not been recorded. All that is known is that
                <QuestEvent>the <epithet ref="hero">Savior of <location type="city"
                    >Bruma</location></epithet> travelled to this <location>Paradise</location>,
                killed <character ref="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</character>, and returned with
                the <QuestItem>Amulet of Kings</QuestItem></QuestEvent>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>With the <QuestItem>Amulet</QuestItem> in hand, <QuestEvent><character
                    ref="MartinSeptim">Martin Septim</character> presented <character
                    ref="MartinSeptim">himself</character> to the <faction ref="empire">Elder
                    Council</faction> to be crowned <epithet ref="MartinSeptim">Emperor of all
                        <location>Tamriel</location></epithet></QuestEvent>. Once crowned <character
                ref="MartinSeptim">he</character> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
                <location>Tamriel</location> from <location>Oblivion</location>. In a last-ditch
            attempt to stop <character ref="MartinSeptim">him</character>, <QuestEvent><character
                    ref="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes Dagon</character> launched an assault on the
                    <location type="city">Imperial City</location>, opening several Oblivion Gates
                within the <location type="city">capital</location> itself</QuestEvent>. Uncrowned,
                <character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin</character> joined the battle in the <location
                type="city">city streets</location>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><QuestEvent><character ref="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes Dagon himself</character>
                left <location>Oblivion</location> and entered
                <location>Tamriel</location></QuestEvent>, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
            Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder, it was
            too late to relighting the Fires. <character ref="MartinSeptim">Martin
                Septim</character> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - <QuestEvent><character
                    ref="MartinSeptim">he</character> shattered the <QuestItem>Amulet of
                    Kings</QuestItem> to become the <character ref="MartinSeptim">avatar of the god
                    Akatosh</character> and do battle with <character ref="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes
                    Dagon</character></QuestEvent>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
                    <QuestEvent><character ref="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes Dagon</character> was
                defeated and sent back to <location>Oblivion</location></QuestEvent>.
                <QuestEvent>The <character ref="MartinSeptim">avatar of Akatosh</character> was
                turned to stone</QuestEvent> and can be seen to this day in the <location>Temple of
                the One</location> in the <location type="city">Imperial City</location>. With the
                <QuestItem>Amulet</QuestItem> gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
            Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to <location>Oblivion</location> is sealed
            forever.</paragraph>
