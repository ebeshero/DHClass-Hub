        <line>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</line>

        <line>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</line>

        <line>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</line></lg>

        <line>Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,</line>
        <line>The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are</line>
        <line>From his low tract, and look another way:</line></lg>
