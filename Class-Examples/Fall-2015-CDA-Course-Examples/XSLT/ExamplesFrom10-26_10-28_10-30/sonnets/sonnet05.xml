        <line>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,</line>
        <line>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:</line></lg>

        <line>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</line>
        <line>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,</line>
        <line>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:</line></lg>

        <line>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</line></lg>
