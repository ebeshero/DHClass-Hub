An annotated bibliography, <ptr target="http://womensbios.lib.virginia.edu"/> led to a relational database of the more than 1200 books and 8000 persons represented in the 13,000 biographical chapters in those books. See <ptr target="http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu/public/index.php"/>. With a stand-aside XML schema, Biographical Elements and Structure Schema, the project team analyzes the narrative conventions of women's biographies in documentary social networks, focusing on sample collections of types of personae.  In 2015-2016, CBW collaborates with <ref target="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu">Social Networks in Archival Contexts</ref> to enhance access to archival records of women worldwide. Booth's research on nineteenth-century transatlantic literary reception history includes a chapter on Mitford and women writers in the completed book, "Homes and Haunts: Visting Writers' Shrines and Countries."</note>

Her current project examines the future-oriented, progressive impulse behind the depictions of the dead and their disposal in British Romantic literature.

Her article on Felicia Hemans and Jeremy Bentham appeared in <title>Women's Writing</title>, and an article on Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Hays is forthcoming.</note>

                     English and Communication at SUNY Potsdam, where she has taught since 2005. Her
                     areas of interest include transatlantic Romantic and Victorian era literature,
                     particularly women’s writing and popular forms such as the Gothic novel and the
                     ballad revival. She is also interested in book history and bibliographical
                     studies, particularly in the study of authorship in the long nineteenth century
                     (1780-1900). She has published in European Romantic Review, Romanticism on the
                     Net (now RaVon), Romantic Circles, Romantic Textualities, and elsewhere. She is
                     currently working on a monograph on Romantic-period authorship and literary
                     celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and coding
                     Mitford’s lengthy “Introduction” to her collected Dramatic Works (1854), a
                     critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at Covent
                     Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching
                     Mitford’s publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly
                     tracking the migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to
                     their later reappearances in collections and periodicals. She and her team of
                     undergraduate student researchers are also working on transcribing, coding, and
                     researching Mitford’s letters from the early 1820s as found in the John Rylands
                     Library at the University of Manchester.

                     <p>A lifelong friend of <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName> who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first major effort to collect and edit Mitford's letters into a series of volumes, which was completed by his assistant, <persName ref="#Lestrange">Alfred Guy Kingan L'Estrange</persName> a year after Harness's death, and published as <title ref="#Lestrange_Letters">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</title>. This collection was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the publishers, to Harness's distress.</p>
                     <p>Harness and <persName ref="#Byron">Byron</persName> were also friends from their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness's experience of a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered dedicating <bibl>the first two cantos of <title>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</title>
                        </bibl> to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness's reputation as he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged Mitford's playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over prose.

The case is very different now; she is still a poker--but a poker of whom every one is afraid. It must be confessed that this silent observation from such an observer is rather formidable. Most writers are good-humoured chatterers--neither very wise nor very witty:--but nine times out of ten (at least in the few that I have known) unaffected and pleasant, and quite removing by their conversation any awe that may have been excited by their works.

                     <p> A West End theater located in Covent Garden in the London borough of
                        Westminster. One of the "patent theaters." First theater on this site was
                        opened in 1732 by John Rich, renovated by architect Henry Holland in 1792,
                        and destroyed by fire on 20 Sept. 1808. The second theater, designed by
                        Robert Smirke, opened on 18 Sept. 1809, managed by <persName ref="#Kemble_JP">John Phillip Kemble</persName>. Because of rent
                        increases by the Duke of Bedford, the landowner, J.P. Kemble increased
                        ticket prices. This led to the "old price (or O.P.) riots" and the eventual
                        lowering of ticket prices, although the proprietors proved they would lose
                        money at those prices. The second theater was destroyed by fire on 5 March
                        1856. The third theater, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, opened in 1858
                        and remains the nucleus of today's theater. The theater became the Royal
                        Opera House in 1892 and the building was renovated and expaneded in the
                        1980s and 1990s.</p>
