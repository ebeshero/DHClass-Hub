         <li>Sonnet 134. So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,</li>

      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <h2>Sonnet 97</h2>
      <p>
    How like a winter hath my absence been<br/>
    From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br/>
    What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br/>
    What old December's bareness everywhere!<br/>
    And yet this time removed was summer's time;<br/>
    The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<br/>
    Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br/>
    Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<br/>
    Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me<br/>
    But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;<br/>
    For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br/>
    And, thou away, the very birds are mute:<br/>
    Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,<br/>
    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 96</h2>
      <p>
    Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;<br/>
    Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;<br/>
    Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:<br/>
    Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.<br/>
    As on the finger of a throned queen<br/>
    The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,<br/>
    So are those errors that in thee are seen<br/>
    To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.<br/>
    How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,<br/>
    If like a lamb he could his looks translate!<br/>
    How many gazers mightst thou lead away,<br/>
    if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!<br/>
    But do not so; I love thee in such sort,<br/>
    As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 26</h2>
      <p>
    Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<br/>
    Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,<br/>
    To thee I send this written embassage,<br/>
    To witness duty, not to show my wit:<br/>
    Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<br/>
    May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,<br/>
    But that I hope some good conceit of thine<br/>
    In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:<br/>
    Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,<br/>
    Points on me graciously with fair aspect,<br/>
    And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,<br/>
    To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:<br/>
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;<br/>
    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 124</h2>
      <p>
    If my dear love were but the child of state,<br/>
    It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,<br/>
    As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,<br/>
    Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.<br/>
    No, it was builded far from accident;<br/>
    It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls<br/>
    Under the blow of thralled discontent,<br/>
    Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:<br/>
    It fears not policy, that heretic,<br/>
    Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,<br/>
    But all alone stands hugely politic,<br/>
    That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.<br/>
    To this I witness call the fools of time,<br/>
    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 150</h2>
      <p>
    O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,<br/>
    With insufficiency my heart to sway?<br/>
    To make me give the lie to my true sight,<br/>
    And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?<br/>
    Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,<br/>
    That in the very refuse of thy deeds<br/>
    There is such strength and warrantise of skill,<br/>
    That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?<br/>
    Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,<br/>
    The more I hear and see just cause of hate?<br/>
    O! though I love what others do abhor,<br/>
    With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:<br/>
    If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,<br/>
    More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 66</h2>
      <p>
    Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,<br/>
    As to behold desert a beggar born,<br/>
    And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,<br/>
    And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br/>
    And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,<br/>
    And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br/>
    And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,<br/>
    And strength by limping sway disabled<br/>
    And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br/>
    And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,<br/>
    And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,<br/>
    And captive good attending captain ill:<br/>
    Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,<br/>
    Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 3</h2>
      <p>
    Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest<br/>
    Now is the time that face should form another;<br/>
    Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br/>
    Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br/>
    For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb<br/>
    Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br/>
    Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br/>
    Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br/>
    Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br/>
    Calls back the lovely April of her prime;<br/>
    So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br/>
    Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br/>
    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,<br/>
    Die single and thine image dies with thee.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 36</h2>
      <p>
    Let me confess that we two must be twain,<br/>
    Although our undivided loves are one:<br/>
    So shall those blots that do with me remain,<br/>
    Without thy help, by me be borne alone.<br/>
    In our two loves there is but one respect,<br/>
    Though in our lives a separable spite,<br/>
    Which though it alter not love's sole effect,<br/>
    Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.<br/>
    I may not evermore acknowledge thee,<br/>
    Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,<br/>
    Nor thou with public kindness honour me,<br/>
    Unless thou take that honour from thy name:<br/>
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,<br/>
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 107</h2>
      <p>
    Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul<br/>
    Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,<br/>
    Can yet the lease of my true love control,<br/>
    Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.<br/>
    The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,<br/>
    And the sad augurs mock their own presage;<br/>
    Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,<br/>
    And peace proclaims olives of endless age.<br/>
    Now with the drops of this most balmy time,<br/>
    My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,<br/>
    Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,<br/>
    While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:<br/>
    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,<br/>
    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 35</h2>
      <p>
    No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:<br/>
    Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:<br/>
    Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,<br/>
    And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.<br/>
    All men make faults, and even I in this,<br/>
    Authorizing thy trespass with compare,<br/>
    Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,<br/>
    Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;<br/>
    For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--<br/>
    Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--<br/>
    And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:<br/>
    Such civil war is in my love and hate,<br/>
    That I an accessary needs must be,<br/>
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 110</h2>
      <p>
    Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,<br/>
    And made my self a motley to the view,<br/>
    Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,<br/>
    Made old offences of affections new;<br/>
    Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth<br/>
    Askance and strangely; but, by all above,<br/>
    These blenches gave my heart another youth,<br/>
    And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.<br/>
    Now all is done, save what shall have no end:<br/>
    Mine appetite I never more will grind<br/>
    On newer proof, to try an older friend,<br/>
    A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.<br/>
    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,<br/>
    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

  </p>
      <h2>Sonnet 113</h2>
      <p>
    Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;<br/>
    And that which governs me to go about<br/>

    Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br/>
    And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,<br/>
    The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;<br/>
    My bonds in thee are all determinate.<br/>
    For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?<br/>
    And for that riches where is my deserving?<br/>
    The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<br/>
    And so my patent back again is swerving.<br/>
    Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,<br/>
    Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;<br/>
    So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,<br/>
    Comes home again, on better judgement making.<br/>
    Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,<br/>
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

    What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,<br/>
    Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,<br/>
    Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,<br/>
    Still losing when I saw myself to win!<br/>
    What wretched errors hath my heart committed,<br/>
    Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!<br/>
    How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,<br/>
    In the distraction of this madding fever!<br/>
    O benefit of ill! now I find true<br/>
    That better is, by evil still made better;<br/>
    And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,<br/>
    Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.<br/>
    So I return rebuk'd to my content,<br/>

    My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;<br/>
    I love not less, though less the show appear;<br/>
    That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,<br/>
    The owner's tongue doth publish every where.<br/>
    Our love was new, and then but in the spring,<br/>
    When I was wont to greet it with my lays;<br/>
    As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,<br/>
    And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:<br/>
    Not that the summer is less pleasant now<br/>
    Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,<br/>
    But that wild music burthens every bough,<br/>
    And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.<br/>
    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:<br/>
    Because I would not dull you with my song.

    When I behold the violet past prime,<br/>
    And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;<br/>
    When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br/>
    Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,<br/>
    And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,<br/>
    Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,<br/>
    Then of thy beauty do I question make,<br/>
    That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br/>
    Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake<br/>
    And die as fast as they see others grow;<br/>
    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence<br/>
    Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

    The ornament of beauty is suspect,<br/>
    A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.<br/>
    So thou be good, slander doth but approve<br/>
    Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;<br/>
    For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,<br/>
    And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.<br/>
    Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days<br/>
    Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;<br/>
    Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,<br/>

    Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:<br/>
    From where thou art why should I haste me thence?<br/>
    Till I return, of posting is no need.<br/>
    O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,<br/>
    When swift extremity can seem but slow?<br/>
    Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,<br/>
    In winged speed no motion shall I know,<br/>
    Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;<br/>
    Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,<br/>
    Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;<br/>

    No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;<br/>

    Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,<br/>
    I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;<br/>

    By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.<br/>
    I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,<br/>
    Although thou steal thee all my poverty:<br/>
    And yet, love knows it is a greater grief<br/>

    Nay, if you read this line, remember not<br/>

    How many a holy and obsequious tear<br/>
