    <line>O! lest the world should task you to recite</line>
    <line>What merit lived in me, that you should love</line>
    <line>After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,</line>
    <line>For you in me can nothing worthy prove;</line>
    <line>Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,</line>
    <line>To do more for me than mine own desert,</line>
    <line>And hang more praise upon deceased I</line>
    <line>Than niggard truth would willingly impart:</line>
    <line>O! lest your true love may seem false in this</line>
    <line>That you for love speak well of me untrue,</line>
    <line>My name be buried where my body is,</line>
    <line>And live no more to shame nor me nor you.</line>
    <line>For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,</line>
    <line>And so should you, to love things nothing worth.</line>
