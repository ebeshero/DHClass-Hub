    <line>From fairest creatures we desire increase,</line>
    <line>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,</line>
    <line>But as the riper should by time decease,</line>
    <line>His tender heir might bear his memory:</line>
    <line>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</line>
    <line>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,</line>
    <line>Making a famine where abundance lies,</line>
    <line>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</line>
    <line>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,</line>
    <line>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</line>
    <line>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</line>
    <line>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:</line>
    <line>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</line>
    <line>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</line>
