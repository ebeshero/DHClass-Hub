    <line>O! call not me to justify the wrong</line>
    <line>That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;</line>
    <line>Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:</line>
    <line>Use power with power, and slay me not by art,</line>
    <line>Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,</line>
    <line>Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:</line>
    <line>What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might</line>
    <line>Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide?</line>
    <line>Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows</line>
    <line>Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;</line>
    <line>And therefore from my face she turns my foes,</line>
    <line>That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:</line>
    <line>Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,</line>
    <line>Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.</line>
