    <line>O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,</line>
    <line>The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,</line>
    <line>That did not better for my life provide</line>
    <line>Than public means which public manners breeds.</line>
    <line>Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,</line>
    <line>And almost thence my nature is subdu'd</line>
    <line>To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:</line>
    <line>Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;</line>
    <line>Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,</line>
    <line>Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;</line>
    <line>No bitterness that I will bitter think,</line>
    <line>Nor double penance, to correct correction.</line>
    <line>Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,</line>
    <line>Even that your pity is enough to cure me.</line>
