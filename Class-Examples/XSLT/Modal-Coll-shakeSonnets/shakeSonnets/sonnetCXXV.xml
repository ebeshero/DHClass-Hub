    <line>Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,</line>
    <line>With my extern the outward honouring,</line>
    <line>Or laid great bases for eternity,</line>
    <line>Which proves more short than waste or ruining?</line>
    <line>Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour</line>
    <line>Lose all and more by paying too much rent</line>
    <line>For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,</line>
    <line>Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?</line>
    <line>No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,</line>
    <line>And take thou my oblation, poor but free,</line>
    <line>Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,</line>
    <line>But mutual render, only me for thee.</line>
    <line>Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul</line>
    <line>When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.</line>
