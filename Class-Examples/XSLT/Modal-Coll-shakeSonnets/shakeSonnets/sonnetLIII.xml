    <line>What is your substance, whereof are you made,</line>
    <line>That millions of strange shadows on you tend?</line>
    <line>Since every one, hath every one, one shade,</line>
    <line>And you but one, can every shadow lend.</line>
    <line>Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit</line>
    <line>Is poorly imitated after you;</line>
    <line>On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,</line>
    <line>And you in Grecian tires are painted new:</line>
    <line>Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,</line>
    <line>The one doth shadow of your beauty show,</line>
    <line>The other as your bounty doth appear;</line>
    <line>And you in every blessed shape we know.</line>
    <line>In all external grace you have some part,</line>
    <line>But you like none, none you, for constant heart.</line>
