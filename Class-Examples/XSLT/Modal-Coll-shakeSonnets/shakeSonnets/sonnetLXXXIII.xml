    <line>I never saw that you did painting need,</line>
    <line>And therefore to your fair no painting set;</line>
    <line>I found, or thought I found, you did exceed</line>
    <line>That barren tender of a poet's debt:</line>
    <line>And therefore have I slept in your report,</line>
    <line>That you yourself, being extant, well might show</line>
    <line>How far a modern quill doth come too short,</line>
    <line>Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.</line>
    <line>This silence for my sin you did impute,</line>
    <line>Which shall be most my glory being dumb;</line>
    <line>For I impair not beauty being mute,</line>
    <line>When others would give life, and bring a tomb.</line>
    <line>There lives more life in one of your fair eyes</line>
    <line>Than both your poets can in praise devise.</line>
