    <line>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,</line>
    <line>Which like two spirits do suggest me still:</line>
    <line>The better angel is a man right fair,</line>
    <line>The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.</line>
    <line>To win me soon to hell, my female evil,</line>
    <line>Tempteth my better angel from my side,</line>
    <line>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,</line>
    <line>Wooing his purity with her foul pride.</line>
    <line>And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,</line>
    <line>Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;</line>
    <line>But being both from me, both to each friend,</line>
    <line>I guess one angel in another's hell:</line>
    <line>Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,</line>
    <line>Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</line>
