    <line>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,</line>
    <line>That thou consum'st thy self in single life?</line>
    <line>Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,</line>
    <line>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;</line>
    <line>The world will be thy widow and still weep</line>
    <line>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</line>
    <line>When every private widow well may keep</line>
    <line>By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:</line>
    <line>Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend</line>
    <line>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;</line>
    <line>But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,</line>
    <line>And kept unused the user so destroys it.</line>
    <line>No love toward others in that bosom sits</line>
    <line>That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.</line>
