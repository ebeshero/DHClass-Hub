    <line>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,</line>
    <line>And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,</line>
    <line>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;</line>
    <line>My bonds in thee are all determinate.</line>
    <line>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?</line>
    <line>And for that riches where is my deserving?</line>
    <line>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</line>
    <line>And so my patent back again is swerving.</line>
    <line>Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,</line>
    <line>Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;</line>
    <line>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,</line>
    <line>Comes home again, on better judgement making.</line>
    <line>Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,</line>
    <line>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.</line>
