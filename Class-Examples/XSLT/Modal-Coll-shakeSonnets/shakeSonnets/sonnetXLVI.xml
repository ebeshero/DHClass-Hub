    <line>Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,</line>
    <line>How to divide the conquest of thy sight;</line>
    <line>Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,</line>
    <line>My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.</line>
    <line>My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--</line>
    <line>A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--</line>
    <line>But the defendant doth that plea deny,</line>
    <line>And says in him thy fair appearance lies.</line>
    <line>To side this title is impannelled</line>
    <line>A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;</line>
    <line>And by their verdict is determined</line>
    <line>The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:</line>
    <line>As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,</line>
    <line>And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.</line>
