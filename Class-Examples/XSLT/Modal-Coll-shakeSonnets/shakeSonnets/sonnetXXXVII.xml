    <line>As a decrepit father takes delight</line>
    <line>To see his active child do deeds of youth,</line>
    <line>So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,</line>
    <line>Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;</line>
    <line>For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,</line>
    <line>Or any of these all, or all, or more,</line>
    <line>Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,</line>
    <line>I make my love engrafted, to this store:</line>
    <line>So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,</line>
    <line>Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give</line>
    <line>That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,</line>
    <line>And by a part of all thy glory live.</line>
    <line>Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:</line>
    <line>This wish I have; then ten times happy me!</line>
