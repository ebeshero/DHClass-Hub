    <line>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,</line>
    <line>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;</line>
    <line>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,</line>
    <line>And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;</line>
    <line>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,</line>
    <line>And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,</line>
    <line>To the wide world and all her fading sweets;</line>
    <line>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:</line>
    <line>O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,</line>
    <line>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;</line>
    <line>Him in thy course untainted do allow</line>
    <line>For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.</line>
    <line>Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,</line>
    <line>My love shall in my verse ever live young.</line>
