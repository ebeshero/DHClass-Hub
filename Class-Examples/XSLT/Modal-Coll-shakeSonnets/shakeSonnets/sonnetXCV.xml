    <line>How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame</line>
    <line>Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,</line>
    <line>Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!</line>
    <line>O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.</line>
    <line>That tongue that tells the story of thy days,</line>
    <line>Making lascivious comments on thy sport,</line>
    <line>Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;</line>
    <line>Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.</line>
    <line>O! what a mansion have those vices got</line>
    <line>Which for their habitation chose out thee,</line>
    <line>Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot</line>
    <line>And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!</line>
    <line>Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;</line>
    <line>The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.</line>
