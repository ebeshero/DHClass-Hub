    <line>No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:</line>
    <line>Thy pyramids built up with newer might</line>
    <line>To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;</line>
    <line>They are but dressings of a former sight.</line>
    <line>Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire</line>
    <line>What thou dost foist upon us that is old;</line>
    <line>And rather make them born to our desire</line>
    <line>Than think that we before have heard them told.</line>
    <line>Thy registers and thee I both defy,</line>
    <line>Not wondering at the present nor the past,</line>
    <line>For thy records and what we see doth lie,</line>
    <line>Made more or less by thy continual haste.</line>
    <line>This I do vow and this shall ever be;</line>
    <line>I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.</line>
