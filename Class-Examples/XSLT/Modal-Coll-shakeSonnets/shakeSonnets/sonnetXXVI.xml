    <line>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage</line>
    <line>Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,</line>
    <line>To thee I send this written embassage,</line>
    <line>To witness duty, not to show my wit:</line>
    <line>Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine</line>
    <line>May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,</line>
    <line>But that I hope some good conceit of thine</line>
    <line>In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:</line>
    <line>Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,</line>
    <line>Points on me graciously with fair aspect,</line>
    <line>And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,</line>
    <line>To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:</line>
    <line>Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;</line>
    <line>Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.</line>
