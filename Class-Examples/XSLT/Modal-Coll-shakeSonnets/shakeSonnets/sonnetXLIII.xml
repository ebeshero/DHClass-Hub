    <line>When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,</line>
    <line>For all the day they view things unrespected;</line>
    <line>But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,</line>
    <line>And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.</line>
    <line>Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,</line>
    <line>How would thy shadow's form form happy show</line>
    <line>To the clear day with thy much clearer light,</line>
    <line>When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!</line>
    <line>How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made</line>
    <line>By looking on thee in the living day,</line>
    <line>When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade</line>
    <line>Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!</line>
    <line>All days are nights to see till I see thee,</line>
    <line>And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.</line>
