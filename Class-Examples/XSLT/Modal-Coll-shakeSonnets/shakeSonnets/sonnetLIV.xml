    <line>O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem</line>
    <line>By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.</line>
    <line>The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem</line>
    <line>For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.</line>
    <line>The canker blooms have full as deep a dye</line>
    <line>As the perfumed tincture of the roses.</line>
    <line>Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly</line>
    <line>When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:</line>
    <line>But, for their virtue only is their show,</line>
    <line>They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;</line>
    <line>Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;</line>
    <line>Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:</line>
    <line>And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</line>
    <line>When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.</line>
