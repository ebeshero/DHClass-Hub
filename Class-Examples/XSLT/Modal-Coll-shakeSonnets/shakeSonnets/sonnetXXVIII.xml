    <line>How can I then return in happy plight,</line>
    <line>That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?</line>
    <line>When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,</line>
    <line>But day by night and night by day oppress'd,</line>
    <line>And each, though enemies to either's reign,</line>
    <line>Do in consent shake hands to torture me,</line>
    <line>The one by toil, the other to complain</line>
    <line>How far I toil, still farther off from thee.</line>
    <line>I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,</line>
    <line>And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:</line>
    <line>So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,</line>
    <line>When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.</line>
    <line>But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,</line>
    <line>And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.</line>
