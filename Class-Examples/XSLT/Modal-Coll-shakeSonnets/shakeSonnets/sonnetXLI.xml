    <line>Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,</line>
    <line>When I am sometime absent from thy heart,</line>
    <line>Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,</line>
    <line>For still temptation follows where thou art.</line>
    <line>Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,</line>
    <line>Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;</line>
    <line>And when a woman woos, what woman's son</line>
    <line>Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?</line>
    <line>Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,</line>
    <line>And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,</line>
    <line>Who lead thee in their riot even there</line>
    <line>Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--</line>
    <line>Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,</line>
    <line>Thine by thy beauty being false to me.</line>
