    <line>Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,</line>
    <line>And each doth good turns now unto the other:</line>
    <line>When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,</line>
    <line>Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,</line>
    <line>With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,</line>
    <line>And to the painted banquet bids my heart;</line>
    <line>Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,</line>
    <line>And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:</line>
    <line>So, either by thy picture or my love,</line>
    <line>Thy self away, art present still with me;</line>
    <line>For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,</line>
    <line>And I am still with them, and they with thee;</line>
    <line>Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight</line>
    <line>Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.</line>
