    <line>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,</line>
    <line>The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;</line>
    <line>But then begins a journey in my head</line>
    <line>To work my mind, when body's work's expired:</line>
    <line>For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--</line>
    <line>Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,</line>
    <line>And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,</line>
    <line>Looking on darkness which the blind do see:</line>
    <line>Save that my soul's imaginary sight</line>
    <line>Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,</line>
    <line>Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,</line>
    <line>Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.</line>
    <line>Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,</line>
    <line>For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.</line>
