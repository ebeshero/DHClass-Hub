    <line>O! never say that I was false of heart,</line>
    <line>Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,</line>
    <line>As easy might I from my self depart</line>
    <line>As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:</line>
    <line>That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,</line>
    <line>Like him that travels, I return again;</line>
    <line>Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,</line>
    <line>So that myself bring water for my stain.</line>
    <line>Never believe though in my nature reign'd,</line>
    <line>All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,</line>
    <line>That it could so preposterously be stain'd,</line>
    <line>To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;</line>
    <line>For nothing this wide universe I call,</line>
    <line>Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.</line>
