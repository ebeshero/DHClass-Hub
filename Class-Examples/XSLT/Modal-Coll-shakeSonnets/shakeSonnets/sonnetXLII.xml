    <line>That thou hast her it is not all my grief,</line>
    <line>And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;</line>
    <line>That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,</line>
    <line>A loss in love that touches me more nearly.</line>
    <line>Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:</line>
    <line>Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;</line>
    <line>And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,</line>
    <line>Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.</line>
    <line>If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,</line>
    <line>And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;</line>
    <line>Both find each other, and I lose both twain,</line>
    <line>And both for my sake lay on me this cross:</line>
    <line>But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;</line>
    <line>Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.</line>
