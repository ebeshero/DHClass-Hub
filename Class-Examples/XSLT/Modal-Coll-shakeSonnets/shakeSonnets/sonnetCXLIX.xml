    <line>Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,</line>
    <line>When I against myself with thee partake?</line>
    <line>Do I not think on thee, when I forgot</line>
    <line>Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?</line>
    <line>Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,</line>
    <line>On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,</line>
    <line>Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend</line>
    <line>Revenge upon myself with present moan?</line>
    <line>What merit do I in my self respect,</line>
    <line>That is so proud thy service to despise,</line>
    <line>When all my best doth worship thy defect,</line>
    <line>Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?</line>
    <line>But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;</line>
    <line>Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.</line>
