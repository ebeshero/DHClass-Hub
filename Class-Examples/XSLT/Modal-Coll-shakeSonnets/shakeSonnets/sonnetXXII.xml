    <line>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</line>
    <line>So long as youth and thou are of one date;</line>
    <line>But when in thee time's furrows I behold,</line>
    <line>Then look I death my days should expiate.</line>
    <line>For all that beauty that doth cover thee,</line>
    <line>Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</line>
    <line>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</line>
    <line>How can I then be elder than thou art?</line>
    <line>O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary</line>
    <line>As I, not for myself, but for thee will;</line>
    <line>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary</line>
    <line>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</line>
    <line>Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,</line>
    <line>Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.</line>
