    <line>Love is too young to know what conscience is,</line>
    <line>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?</line>
    <line>Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,</line>
    <line>Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:</line>
    <line>For, thou betraying me, I do betray</line>
    <line>My nobler part to my gross body's treason;</line>
    <line>My soul doth tell my body that he may</line>
    <line>Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,</line>
    <line>But rising at thy name doth point out thee,</line>
    <line>As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,</line>
    <line>He is contented thy poor drudge to be,</line>
    <line>To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.</line>
    <line>No want of conscience hold it that I call</line>
    <line>Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.</line>
