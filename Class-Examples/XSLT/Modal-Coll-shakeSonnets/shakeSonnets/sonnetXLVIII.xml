    <line>How careful was I when I took my way,</line>
    <line>Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,</line>
    <line>That to my use it might unused stay</line>
    <line>From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!</line>
    <line>But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,</line>
    <line>Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,</line>
    <line>Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,</line>
    <line>Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.</line>
    <line>Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,</line>
    <line>Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,</line>
    <line>Within the gentle closure of my breast,</line>
    <line>From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;</line>
    <line>And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,</line>
    <line>For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.</line>
