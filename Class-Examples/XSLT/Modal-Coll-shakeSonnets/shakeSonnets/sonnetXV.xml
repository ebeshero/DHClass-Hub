    <line>When I consider every thing that grows</line>
    <line>Holds in perfection but a little moment,</line>
    <line>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</line>
    <line>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</line>
    <line>When I perceive that men as plants increase,</line>
    <line>Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,</line>
    <line>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</line>
    <line>And wear their brave state out of memory;</line>
    <line>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</line>
    <line>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</line>
    <line>Where wasteful Time debateth with decay</line>
    <line>To change your day of youth to sullied night,</line>
    <line>And all in war with Time for love of you,</line>
    <line>As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</line>
