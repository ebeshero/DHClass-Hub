    <line>Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan</line>
    <line>For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!</line>
    <line>Is't not enough to torture me alone,</line>
    <line>But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?</line>
    <line>Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,</line>
    <line>And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:</line>
    <line>Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;</line>
    <line>A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:</line>
    <line>Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,</line>
    <line>But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;</line>
    <line>Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;</line>
    <line>Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:</line>
    <line>And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,</line>
    <line>Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.</line>
