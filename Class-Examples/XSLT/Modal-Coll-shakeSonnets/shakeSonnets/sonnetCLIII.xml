    <line>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:</line>
    <line>A maid of Dian's this advantage found,</line>
    <line>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep</line>
    <line>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;</line>
    <line>Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,</line>
    <line>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,</line>
    <line>And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove</line>
    <line>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.</line>
    <line>But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,</line>
    <line>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;</line>
    <line>I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,</line>
    <line>And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,</line>
    <line>But found no cure, the bath for my help lies</line>
    <line>Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.</line>
