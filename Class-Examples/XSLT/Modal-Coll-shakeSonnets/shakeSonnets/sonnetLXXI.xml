    <line>No longer mourn for me when I am dead</line>
    <line>Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell</line>
    <line>Give warning to the world that I am fled</line>
    <line>From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:</line>
    <line>Nay, if you read this line, remember not</line>
    <line>The hand that writ it, for I love you so,</line>
    <line>That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,</line>
    <line>If thinking on me then should make you woe.</line>
    <line>O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,</line>
    <line>When I perhaps compounded am with clay,</line>
    <line>Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;</line>
    <line>But let your love even with my life decay;</line>
    <line>Lest the wise world should look into your moan,</line>
    <line>And mock you with me after I am gone.</line>
