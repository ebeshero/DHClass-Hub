    <line>To me, fair friend, you never can be old,</line>
    <line>For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,</line>
    <line>Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,</line>
    <line>Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,</line>
    <line>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,</line>
    <line>In process of the seasons have I seen,</line>
    <line>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,</line>
    <line>Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.</line>
    <line>Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,</line>
    <line>Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;</line>
    <line>So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,</line>
    <line>Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:</line>
    <line>For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:</line>
    <line>Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.</line>
