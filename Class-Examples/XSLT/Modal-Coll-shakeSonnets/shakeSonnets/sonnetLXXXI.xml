    <line>Or I shall live your epitaph to make,</line>
    <line>Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;</line>
    <line>From hence your memory death cannot take,</line>
    <line>Although in me each part will be forgotten.</line>
    <line>Your name from hence immortal life shall have,</line>
    <line>Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:</line>
    <line>The earth can yield me but a common grave,</line>
    <line>When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.</line>
    <line>Your monument shall be my gentle verse,</line>
    <line>Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;</line>
    <line>And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,</line>
    <line>When all the breathers of this world are dead;</line>
    <line>You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--</line>
    <line>Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.</line>
