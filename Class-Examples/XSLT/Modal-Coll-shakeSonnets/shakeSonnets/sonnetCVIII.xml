    <line>What's in the brain, that ink may character,</line>
    <line>Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?</line>
    <line>What's new to speak, what now to register,</line>
    <line>That may express my love, or thy dear merit?</line>
    <line>Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,</line>
    <line>I must each day say o'er the very same;</line>
    <line>Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</line>
    <line>Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.</line>
    <line>So that eternal love in love's fresh case,</line>
    <line>Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</line>
    <line>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,</line>
    <line>But makes antiquity for aye his page;</line>
    <line>Finding the first conceit of love there bred,</line>
    <line>Where time and outward form would show it dead.</line>
