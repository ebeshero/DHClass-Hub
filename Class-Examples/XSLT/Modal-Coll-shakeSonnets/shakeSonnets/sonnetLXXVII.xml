    <line>Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,</line>
    <line>Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;</line>
    <line>These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,</line>
    <line>And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.</line>
    <line>The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show</line>
    <line>Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;</line>
    <line>Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know</line>
    <line>Time's thievish progress to eternity.</line>
    <line>Look! what thy memory cannot contain,</line>
    <line>Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find</line>
    <line>Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,</line>
    <line>To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.</line>
    <line>These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,</line>
    <line>Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.</line>
