    <line>When I do count the clock that tells the time,</line>
    <line>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;</line>
    <line>When I behold the violet past prime,</line>
    <line>And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;</line>
    <line>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</line>
    <line>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,</line>
    <line>And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,</line>
    <line>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,</line>
    <line>Then of thy beauty do I question make,</line>
    <line>That thou among the wastes of time must go,</line>
    <line>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake</line>
    <line>And die as fast as they see others grow;</line>
    <line>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence</line>
    <line>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</line>
