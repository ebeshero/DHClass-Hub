    <line>Being your slave what should I do but tend,</line>
    <line>Upon the hours, and times of your desire?</line>
    <line>I have no precious time at all to spend;</line>
    <line>Nor services to do, till you require.</line>
    <line>Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,</line>
    <line>Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,</line>
    <line>Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,</line>
    <line>When you have bid your servant once adieu;</line>
    <line>Nor dare I question with my jealous thought</line>
    <line>Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,</line>
    <line>But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought</line>
    <line>Save, where you are, how happy you make those.</line>
    <line>So true a fool is love, that in your will,</line>
    <line>Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.</line>
