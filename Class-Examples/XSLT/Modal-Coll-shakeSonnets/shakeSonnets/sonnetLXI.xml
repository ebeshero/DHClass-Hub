    <line>Is it thy will, thy image should keep open</line>
    <line>My heavy eyelids to the weary night?</line>
    <line>Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,</line>
    <line>While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?</line>
    <line>Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee</line>
    <line>So far from home into my deeds to pry,</line>
    <line>To find out shames and idle hours in me,</line>
    <line>The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?</line>
    <line>O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:</line>
    <line>It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:</line>
    <line>Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,</line>
    <line>To play the watchman ever for thy sake:</line>
    <line>For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,</line>
    <line>From me far off, with others all too near.</line>
