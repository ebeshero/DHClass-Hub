    <line>My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;</line>
    <line>I love not less, though less the show appear;</line>
    <line>That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,</line>
    <line>The owner's tongue doth publish every where.</line>
    <line>Our love was new, and then but in the spring,</line>
    <line>When I was wont to greet it with my lays;</line>
    <line>As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,</line>
    <line>And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:</line>
    <line>Not that the summer is less pleasant now</line>
    <line>Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,</line>
    <line>But that wild music burthens every bough,</line>
    <line>And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.</line>
    <line>Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:</line>
    <line>Because I would not dull you with my song.</line>
