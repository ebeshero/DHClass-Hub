    <line>Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,</line>
    <line>That having such a scope to show her pride,</line>
    <line>The argument, all bare, is of more worth</line>
    <line>Than when it hath my added praise beside!</line>
    <line>O! blame me not, if I no more can write!</line>
    <line>Look in your glass, and there appears a face</line>
    <line>That over-goes my blunt invention quite,</line>
    <line>Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.</line>
    <line>Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,</line>
    <line>To mar the subject that before was well?</line>
    <line>For to no other pass my verses tend</line>
    <line>Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;</line>
    <line>And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,</line>
    <line>Your own glass shows you when you look in it.</line>
