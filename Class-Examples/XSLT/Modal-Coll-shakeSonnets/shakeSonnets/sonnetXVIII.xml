    <line>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</line>
    <line>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</line>
    <line>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</line>
    <line>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</line>
    <line>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</line>
    <line>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</line>
    <line>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</line>
    <line>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</line>
    <line>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</line>
    <line>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</line>
    <line>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</line>
    <line>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</line>
    <line>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</line>
    <line>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</line>
