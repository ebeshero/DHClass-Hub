    <line>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</line>
    <line>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</line>
    <line>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,</line>
    <line>Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:</line>
    <line>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,</line>
    <line>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;</line>
    <line>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,</line>
    <line>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</line>
    <line>How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,</line>
    <line>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine</line>
    <line>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'</line>
    <line>Proving his beauty by succession thine!</line>
    <line>This were to be new made when thou art old,</line>
    <line>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</line>
