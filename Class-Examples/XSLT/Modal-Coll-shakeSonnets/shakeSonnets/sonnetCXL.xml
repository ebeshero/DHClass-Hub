    <line>Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press</line>
    <line>My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;</line>
    <line>Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express</line>
    <line>The manner of my pity-wanting pain.</line>
    <line>If I might teach thee wit, better it were,</line>
    <line>Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;--</line>
    <line>As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,</line>
    <line>No news but health from their physicians know;--</line>
    <line>For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,</line>
    <line>And in my madness might speak ill of thee;</line>
    <line>Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,</line>
    <line>Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.</line>
    <line>That I may not be so, nor thou belied,</line>
    <line>Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.</line>
