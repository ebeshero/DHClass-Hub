    <line>Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,</line>
    <line>And I will comment upon that offence:</line>
    <line>Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,</line>
    <line>Against thy reasons making no defence.</line>
    <line>Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,</line>
    <line>To set a form upon desired change,</line>
    <line>As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,</line>
    <line>I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;</line>
    <line>Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue</line>
    <line>Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,</line>
    <line>Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,</line>
    <line>And haply of our old acquaintance tell.</line>
    <line>For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,</line>
    <line>For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.</line>
