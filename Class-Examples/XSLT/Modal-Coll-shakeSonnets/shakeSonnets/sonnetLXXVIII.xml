    <line>So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,</line>
    <line>And found such fair assistance in my verse</line>
    <line>As every alien pen hath got my use</line>
    <line>And under thee their poesy disperse.</line>
    <line>Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing</line>
    <line>And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,</line>
    <line>Have added feathers to the learned's wing</line>
    <line>And given grace a double majesty.</line>
    <line>Yet be most proud of that which I compile,</line>
    <line>Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:</line>
    <line>In others' works thou dost but mend the style,</line>
    <line>And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;</line>
    <line>But thou art all my art, and dost advance</line>
    <line>As high as learning, my rude ignorance.</line>
