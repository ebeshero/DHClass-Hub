    <line>As an unperfect actor on the stage,</line>
    <line>Who with his fear is put beside his part,</line>
    <line>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,</line>
    <line>Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;</line>
    <line>So I, for fear of trust, forget to say</line>
    <line>The perfect ceremony of love's rite,</line>
    <line>And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,</line>
    <line>O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.</line>
    <line>O! let my looks be then the eloquence</line>
    <line>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</line>
    <line>Who plead for love, and look for recompense,</line>
    <line>More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.</line>
    <line>O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:</line>
    <line>To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.</line>
