    <line>Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,</line>
    <line>Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,</line>
    <line>Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;</line>
    <line>Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;</line>
    <line>And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,</line>
    <line>Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:</line>
    <line>But these particulars are not my measure,</line>
    <line>All these I better in one general best.</line>
    <line>Thy love is better than high birth to me,</line>
    <line>Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,</line>
    <line>Of more delight than hawks and horses be;</line>
    <line>And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:</line>
    <line>Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take</line>
    <line>All this away, and me most wretchcd make.</line>
