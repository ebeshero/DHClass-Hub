    <line>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,</line>
    <line>Injurious distance should not stop my way;</line>
    <line>For then despite of space I would be brought,</line>
    <line>From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.</line>
    <line>No matter then although my foot did stand</line>
    <line>Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;</line>
    <line>For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,</line>
    <line>As soon as think the place where he would be.</line>
    <line>But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,</line>
    <line>To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,</line>
    <line>But that so much of earth and water wrought,</line>
    <line>I must attend time's leisure with my moan;</line>
    <line>Receiving nought by elements so slow</line>
    <line>But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.</line>
