    <line>In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,</line>
    <line>For they in thee a thousand errors note;</line>
    <line>But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,</line>
    <line>Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.</line>
    <line>Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;</line>
    <line>Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,</line>
    <line>Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited</line>
    <line>To any sensual feast with thee alone:</line>
    <line>But my five wits nor my five senses can</line>
    <line>Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,</line>
    <line>Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,</line>
    <line>Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:</line>
    <line>Only my plague thus far I count my gain,</line>
    <line>That she that makes me sin awards me pain.</line>
