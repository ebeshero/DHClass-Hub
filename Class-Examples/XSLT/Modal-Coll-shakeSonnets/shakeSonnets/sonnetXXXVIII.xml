    <line>How can my muse want subject to invent,</line>
    <line>While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse</line>
    <line>Thine own sweet argument, too excellent</line>
    <line>For every vulgar paper to rehearse?</line>
    <line>O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me</line>
    <line>Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;</line>
    <line>For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,</line>
    <line>When thou thy self dost give invention light?</line>
    <line>Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth</line>
    <line>Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;</line>
    <line>And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth</line>
    <line>Eternal numbers to outlive long date.</line>
    <line>If my slight muse do please these curious days,</line>
    <line>The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.</line>
