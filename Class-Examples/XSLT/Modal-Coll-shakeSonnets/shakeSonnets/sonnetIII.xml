    <line>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest</line>
    <line>Now is the time that face should form another;</line>
    <line>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</line>
    <line>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</line>
    <line>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb</line>
    <line>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</line>
    <line>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</line>
    <line>Of his self-love to stop posterity?</line>
    <line>Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee</line>
    <line>Calls back the lovely April of her prime;</line>
    <line>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</line>
    <line>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</line>
    <line>But if thou live, remember'd not to be,</line>
    <line>Die single and thine image dies with thee.</line>
