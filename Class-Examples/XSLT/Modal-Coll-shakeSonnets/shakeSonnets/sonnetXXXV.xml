    <line>No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:</line>
    <line>Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:</line>
    <line>Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,</line>
    <line>And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.</line>
    <line>All men make faults, and even I in this,</line>
    <line>Authorizing thy trespass with compare,</line>
    <line>Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,</line>
    <line>Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;</line>
    <line>For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--</line>
    <line>Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--</line>
    <line>And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:</line>
    <line>Such civil war is in my love and hate,</line>
    <line>That I an accessary needs must be,</line>
    <line>To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.</line>
