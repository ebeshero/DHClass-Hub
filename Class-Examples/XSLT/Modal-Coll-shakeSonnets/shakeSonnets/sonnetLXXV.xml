    <line>So are you to my thoughts as food to life,</line>
    <line>Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;</line>
    <line>And for the peace of you I hold such strife</line>
    <line>As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.</line>
    <line>Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon</line>
    <line>Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;</line>
    <line>Now counting best to be with you alone,</line>
    <line>Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:</line>
    <line>Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,</line>
    <line>And by and by clean starved for a look;</line>
    <line>Possessing or pursuing no delight,</line>
    <line>Save what is had, or must from you be took.</line>
    <line>Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,</line>
    <line>Or gluttoning on all, or all away.</line>
