    <line>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</line>
    <line>Bound for the prize of all too precious you,</line>
    <line>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,</line>
    <line>Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</line>
    <line>Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,</line>
    <line>Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?</line>
    <line>No, neither he, nor his compeers by night</line>
    <line>Giving him aid, my verse astonished.</line>
    <line>He, nor that affable familiar ghost</line>
    <line>Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,</line>
    <line>As victors of my silence cannot boast;</line>
    <line>I was not sick of any fear from thence:</line>
    <line>But when your countenance fill'd up his line,</line>
    <line>Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.</line>
