    <line>But do thy worst to steal thyself away,</line>
    <line>For term of life thou art assured mine;</line>
    <line>And life no longer than thy love will stay,</line>
    <line>For it depends upon that love of thine.</line>
    <line>Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,</line>
    <line>When in the least of them my life hath end.</line>
    <line>I see a better state to me belongs</line>
    <line>Than that which on thy humour doth depend:</line>
    <line>Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,</line>
    <line>Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.</line>
    <line>O! what a happy title do I find,</line>
    <line>Happy to have thy love, happy to die!</line>
    <line>But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?</line>
    <line>Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.</line>
