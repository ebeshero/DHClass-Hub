    <line>Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said</line>
    <line>Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,</line>
    <line>Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,</line>
    <line>To-morrow sharpened in his former might:</line>
    <line>So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill</line>
    <line>Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,</line>
    <line>To-morrow see again, and do not kill</line>
    <line>The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.</line>
    <line>Let this sad interim like the ocean be</line>
    <line>Which parts the shore, where two contracted new</line>
    <line>Come daily to the banks, that when they see</line>
    <line>Return of love, more blest may be the view;</line>
    <line>Or call it winter, which being full of care,</line>
    <line>Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.</line>
