    <line>O! how I faint when I of you do write,</line>
    <line>Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,</line>
    <line>And in the praise thereof spends all his might,</line>
    <line>To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!</line>
    <line>But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--</line>
    <line>The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,</line>
    <line>My saucy bark, inferior far to his,</line>
    <line>On your broad main doth wilfully appear.</line>
    <line>Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,</line>
    <line>Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;</line>
    <line>Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,</line>
    <line>He of tall building, and of goodly pride:</line>
    <line>Then if he thrive and I be cast away,</line>
    <line>The worst was this,--my love was my decay.</line>
