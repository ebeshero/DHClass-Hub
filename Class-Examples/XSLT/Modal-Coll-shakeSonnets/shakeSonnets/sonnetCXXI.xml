    <line>'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd, </line>
    <line>When not to be receives reproach of being;</line>
    <line>And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd</line>
    <line>Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:</line>
    <line>For why should others' false adulterate eyes</line>
    <line>Give salutation to my sportive blood?</line>
    <line>Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,</line>
    <line>Which in their wills count bad what I think good?</line>
    <line>No, I am that I am, and they that level</line>
    <line>At my abuses reckon up their own:</line>
    <line>I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;</line>
    <line>By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;</line>
    <line>Unless this general evil they maintain,</line>
    <line>All men are bad and in their badness reign.</line>
