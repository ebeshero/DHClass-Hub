    <line>But be contented: when that fell arrest</line>
    <line>Without all bail shall carry me away,</line>
    <line>My life hath in this line some interest,</line>
    <line>Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.</line>
    <line>When thou reviewest this, thou dost review</line>
    <line>The very part was consecrate to thee:</line>
    <line>The earth can have but earth, which is his due;</line>
    <line>My spirit is thine, the better part of me:</line>
    <line>So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,</line>
    <line>The prey of worms, my body being dead;</line>
    <line>The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,</line>
    <line>Too base of thee to be remembered.</line>
    <line>The worth of that is that which it contains,</line>
    <line>And that is this, and this with thee remains.</line>
