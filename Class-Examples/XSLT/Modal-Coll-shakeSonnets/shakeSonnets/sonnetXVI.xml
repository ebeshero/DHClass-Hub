    <line>But wherefore do not you a mightier way</line>
    <line>Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?</line>
    <line>And fortify your self in your decay</line>
    <line>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</line>
    <line>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</line>
    <line>And many maiden gardens, yet unset,</line>
    <line>With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,</line>
    <line>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</line>
    <line>So should the lines of life that life repair,</line>
    <line>Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,</line>
    <line>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,</line>
    <line>Can make you live your self in eyes of men.</line>
    <line>To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,</line>
    <line>And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.</line>
