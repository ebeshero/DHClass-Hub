    <line>O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power</line>
    <line>Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;</line>
    <line>Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st</line>
    <line>Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.</line>
    <line>If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,</line>
    <line>As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,</line>
    <line>She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill</line>
    <line>May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.</line>
    <line>Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!</line>
    <line>She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:</line>
    <line>Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,</line>
    <line>And her quietus is to render thee.</line>
