    <line>Who is it that says most, which can say more,</line>
    <line>Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?</line>
    <line>In whose confine immured is the store</line>
    <line>Which should example where your equal grew.</line>
    <line>Lean penury within that pen doth dwell</line>
    <line>That to his subject lends not some small glory;</line>
    <line>But he that writes of you, if he can tell</line>
    <line>That you are you, so dignifies his story,</line>
    <line>Let him but copy what in you is writ,</line>
    <line>Not making worse what nature made so clear,</line>
    <line>And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,</line>
    <line>Making his style admired every where.</line>
    <line>You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,</line>
    <line>Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.</line>
