        <line>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:</line>
        <line>Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,</line>
        <line>Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?</line></lg>
    <lg type="quatrain"><line>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</line>
        <line>By unions married, do offend thine ear,</line>
        <line>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</line>

    <lg type="quatrain"><line>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</line>
        <line>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</line>
        <line>Resembling sire and child and happy mother,</line>
        <line>Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</line></lg>
    <lg type="couplet"><line>Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,</line>
        <line>Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'</line></lg>
