1 1/2 tsp	baking powder
1 1/4 tsp	baking soda
1 1/2 tsp	coarse sea salt (plus additional salt for sprinkling lightly on cookies)
10 oz (2 1/2 stick)	unsalted butter
10 oz (1 2/3 cup)	lightly packed light brown sugar
8 oz (1 cup)	granulated sugar
2 whole	large eggs
2 tsp	vanilla extract
18 to 20 oz	bittersweet chocolate (cut into large chip-size chunks (I recommend chocolate with at least 60% cacao content and prefer Scharffen Berger or Callebaut.))
whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, & salt together in a bowl. set aside.
cream butter and sugars together until lightened, 3-5 minutes.
add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. stir in vanilla.
add dry ingredients, mixing at lowest speed until just combined.
drop chocolate pieces in and mix in gently, by hand.
wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for 24 hours.
preheat oven to 325˚f in a convection oven. if convection is not available, preheat conventional oven to 350˚f.
roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls an place an inch apart on a cookie sheet lined with a silpat liner or parchment paper.
sprinkle very lightly with sea salt and bake until golden around the edges, 12-15 minutes (on the longer side for conventional ovens).
allow cookies to cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then remove them to a wire rack to cool further.
