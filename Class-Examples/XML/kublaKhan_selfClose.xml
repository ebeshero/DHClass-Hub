In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<lb/>
A stately pleasure-dome decree:<lb/>
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<lb/>
Through caverns measureless to man<lb/>
Down to a sunless sea.<lb/>

So twice five miles of fertile ground<lb/>
With walls and towers were girdled round:<lb/>
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<lb/>
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<lb/>
And here were forests ancient as the hills,<lb/>
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<lb/>

But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<lb/>
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<lb/>
A savage place! as holy and enchanted<lb/>
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<lb/>
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<lb/>
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<lb/>
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<lb/>
A mighty fountain momently was forced:<lb/>
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<lb/>
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<lb/>
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:<lb/>
And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<lb/>
It flung up momently the sacred river.<lb/>
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<lb/>
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<lb/>
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<lb/>
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:<lb/>
And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<lb/>
Ancestral voices prophesying war!<lb/>

The shadow of the dome of pleasure<lb/>
Floated midway on the waves;<lb/>
Where was heard the mingled measure<lb/>
From the fountain and the caves.<lb/>
It was a miracle of rare device,<lb/>
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<lb/>

A damsel with a dulcimer<lb/>
In a vision once I saw:<lb/>
It was an Abyssinian maid,<lb/>
And on her dulcimer she played,<lb/>
Singing of Mount Abora.<lb/>
Could I revive within me<lb/>
Her symphony and song,<lb/>
To such a deep delight 'twould win me<lb/>
That with music loud and long<lb/>
I would build that dome in air,<lb/>
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<lb/>
And all who heard should see them there,<lb/>
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<lb/>
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<lb/>
Weave a circle round him thrice,<lb/>
And close your eyes with holy dread,<lb/>
For he on honey-dew hath fed<lb/>
And drunk the milk of Paradise.<lb/>
