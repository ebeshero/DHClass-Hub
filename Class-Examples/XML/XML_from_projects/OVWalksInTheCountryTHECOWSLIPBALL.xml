                <head>WALKS IN THE COUNTRY.<lb/> THE COWSLIP-BALL.</head>
                <p>May 16.—There are moments in life, when, without any visible or immediate cause,
                    the spirits sink and fail, as it were, under the mere pressure of existence:
                    moments of unaccountable depression, when one is weary of one’s very thoughts,
                    haunted by images that will not depart—images many and various, but all painful;
                    friends lost, or changed, or dead; hopes disappointed even in their
                    accomplishment; fruitless regrets, powerless wishes, doubt and fear and
                    self-distrust, and self-diapprobation. They who have known these feelings, (and
                    who is there so happy as not to have known some of them?) will understand why
                    Alfieri became powerless, and Froissart dull; and why even needle-work, that
                    most effectual sedative, that grand soother and composer of woman’s distress,
                    fails to comfort me to-day. I will go out into the air this cool pleasant
                    afternoon, and try what that will do. I<pb n="133"/> fancy that exercise, or
                    <!--2017-01-24 bas here. --> exertion of any kind, is the true specific for nervousness.
                    “Fling but a stone, the giant dies.” I will go to the meadows, the beautiful
                    meadows! and I will have my materials of happiness, Lizzy and May, and a basket
                    for flowers, and we will make a cowslip-ball. “Did you ever see a cowslip-ball,
                    my Lizzy?”—“No.”—“Come away, then; make haste! run, Lizzy!”</p>
                <p>And on we go fast, fast! down the road, across the lea, past the workhouse, along
                    by the great pond, till we slide into the deep narrow lane, whose hedges seem to
                    meet over the water, and win our way to the little farm-house at the end.
                    “Through the farm-yard, Lizzy; over the gate; never mind the cows; they are
                    quiet enough.”—“I don’t mind ‘em,” said Miss Lizzy, boldly and truly, and with a
                    proud affronted air, displeased at being thought to mind any thing, and showing
                    by her attitude and manner some design of proving her courage by an attack on
                    the largest of the herd, in the shape of a pull by the tail. “I don’t mind
                    ‘em.”—“I know you don’t, Lizzy; but let them alone, and don’t chase the
                    turkey-cock. Come to me, my dear!” and, for a wonder, Lizzy came.</p>
                <p>In the meantime my other pet, May-flower, had also gotten into a scrape. She had
                    driven about a huge unwieldy sow, till the animal’s grunting had disturbed the
                    repose of a still more enormous Newfound<pb n="134"/>land dog, the guardian of
                    the yard. Out he sallied growling from the depth of his kennel, erecting his
                    tail, and shaking his long chain. May’s attention was instantly diverted from
                    the sow to this new playmate, friend or foe, she cared not which; and he of the
                    kennel, seeing his charge unhurt and out of danger, was at leisure to observe
                    the charms of his fair enemy, as she frolicked round him, always beyond the
                    reach of his chain, yet always with the natural instinctive coquetry of her sex,
                    alluring him to the pursuit which she knew to be vain. I never saw a prettier
                    flirtation. At last the noble animal, wearied out, retired to the inmost
                    recesses of his habitation, and would not even approach her when she stood right
                    before the entrance. “You are properly served, May. Come along, Lizzy. Across
                    this wheat-field, and now over the gate. Stop! let me lift you down. No jumping,
                    no breaking of necks, Lizzy! And here we are in the meadows, and out of the
                    world. Robinson Crusoe, in his lonely island, had scarcely a more complete, or a
                    more beautiful solitude.” </p>
                <p>These meadows consist of a double row of small enclosures of rich grass-land, a
                    mile or two in length, sloping down from high arable grounds on either side, to
                    a little nameless brook that winds between them, with a course which in its
                    infinite variety, clearness, and rapidity, seems to emulate the bold rivers of
                        the<pb n="135"/> north, of whom, far more than of our lazy southern streams,
                    our rivulet present a miniature likeness. Never was water more exquisitely
                    tricksy:—now darting over the bright pebbles, sparkling and flashing in the
                    light with a bubbling music, as sweet and wild as the song of the woodlark; now
                    stretching quietly along, giving back the rich tufts of the golden
                    marsh-marygolds which grow on its margin; now sweeping round a fine reach of
                    green grass, rising steeply into a high mound, a mimic promontory, whilst the
                    other side sinks softly away, like some tiny bay, and the water flows between,
                    so clear, so wide, so shallow, that Lizzy, longing for adventure, is sure she
                    could cross unwetted; now dashing through two sandbanks, a torrent deep and
                    narrow, which May clears at a bound; now sleeping half-hidden beneath the alders
                    and hawthorns and wild roses, with which the banks are so profusely and
                    variously fringed, whilst flags<note type="author" anchored="true">Walking along
                        these meadows one bright sunny afternoon, a year or two back, and rather
                        later in the season, I had an opportunity of observing a curious
                        circumstance in natural history. Standing close to the edge of the stream, I
                        remarked a singular appearance on a large tuft of flags. It looked like
                        bunches of flowers, the leaves of which seemed dark, yet transparent,
                        intermingled with brilliant tubes of bright blue or shining green. On
                        examining this phenomenon more closely, it turned out to be several clusters
                        of dragon-flies, just emerged from their deformed crysalis state, and still
                        torpid and motionless from the wetness of their filmy wings. Half an hour
                        later we returned to the spot, and they were gone. We had seen them at the
                        very moment when beauty was complete, and animation dormant. I have since
                        found nearly a similar account of this curious process in Mr. Bingley’s very
                        entertaining work, called “Animal Biography.”</note>, lilies, and other
                    aquatic plants, almost cover<pb n="136"/> the surface of the stream. In good
                    truth it is a beautiful brook, and one that Walton himself might have sitten by
                    and loved, for trout are there; we see them as they dart up the stream, and hear
                    and start at the sudden plunge when they spring to the surface for the summer
                    flies. Izaac Walton would have loved our brook and our quiet meadows; they
                    breathe the very spirit of his own peacefulness, a soothing quietude that sinks
                    into the soul. There is no path through them, not one; we might wander a whole
                    spring day, and not see a trace of human habitation. They belong to a number of
                    small proprietors, who allow each other access through their respective grounds,
                    from pure kindness and neighbourly feeling, a privilege never abused; and the
                    fields on the other side of the water are reached by a rough plank, or a tree
                    thrown across, or some such homely bridge. We ourselves possess one of the most
                    beautiful; so that the strange pleasure of property, that instinct which makes
                    Lizzy delight in her broken doll, and May in the bare bone which she has
                    pilfered from the kennel of her recreant<pb n="137"/> admirer of Newfoundland,
                    is added to the other charms of this enchanting scenery; a strange pleasure it
                    is, when one so poor as I can feel it! Perhaps it is felt most by the poor, with
                    the rich it may be less intense—too much diffused and spread out, becoming thin
                    by expansion, like leaf-gold; the little of the poor may be not only more
                    precious, but more pleasant to them: certain that bit of grassy and blossomy
                    earth, with its green knolls and tufted bushes, its old pollards wreathed with
                    ivy, and its bright and babbling waters, is very dear to me. But I must always
                    have loved these meadows, so fresh, and cool, and delicious to the eye and to
                    the tread, full of cowslips, and of all vernal flowers: Shakspeare’s Song of
                    Spring bursts irrepressibly from our lips as we step on them: <quote>“<lg>
                            <l>When daisies pied, and violets blue,</l>
                            <l>And lady-smocks all silver white,</l>
                            <l>And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue,</l>
                            <l>Do paint the meadows with delight,</l>
                            <l>The cuckoo then on every tree—</l>
                        </lg>”</quote> “Cuckoo! cuckoo!” cried Lizzy, breaking in with her clear
                    childish voice; and immediately, as if at her call, the real bird, from a
                    neighbouring tree (for these meadows are dotted with timber like a park), began
                    to echo my lovely little girl, “cuckoo! cuckoo!” I have a prejudice very
                    unpastoral and unpoetical (but I<pb n="138"/> cannot help it, I have many such),
                    against this “harbinger of spring.” His note is so monotonous, so melancholy;
                    and then the boys mimic him; one hears “cuckoo! cuckoo!” in dirty streets,
                    amongst smoky houses, and the bird is hated for faults not his own. But
                    prejudices of taste, likings and dislikings, are not always vanquishable by
                    reason; so, to escape the serenade from the tree, which promised to be of
                    considerable duration, (when once that eternal song begins, on it goes ticking
                    like a clock)—to escape that noise I determined to excite another, and
                    challenged Lizzy to a cowslip-gathering; a trial of skill and speed, to see
                    which should soonest fill her basket. My stratagem succeeded completely. What
                    scrambling, what shouting, what glee from Lizzy! twenty cuckoos might have sung
                    unheard whilst she was pulling her own flowers, and stealing mine, and laughing,
                    screaming, and talking through all. </p>
                <p>At last the baskets were filled, and Lizzy declared victor: and down we sate, on
                    the brink of the stream, under a spreading hawthorn, just disclosing its own
                    pearly buds, and surrounded with the rich and enamelled flowers of the wild
                    hyacinth, blue and white, to make our cowslip-ball. Every one knows the process;
                    to nip off the tuft of flowerets just below the top of the stalk, and hang each
                    cluster nicely balanced across a riband, till you have a long string like a
                        gar<pb n="139"/>land; then to press them closely together, and tie them
                    tightly up. We went on very prosperously, considering; as people say of a young
                    lady’s drawing, or a Frenchman’s English, or a woman’s tragedy, or of the poor
                    little dwarf who works without fingers, or the ingenious sailor who writes with
                    his toes, or generally of any performance which is accomplished by means
                    seemingly inadequate to its production. To be sure we met with a few accidents.
                    First, Lizzy spoiled nearly all her cowslips by snapping them off too short; so
                    there was a fresh gathering; in the next place May overset my full basket, and
                    sent the blossoms floating, like so many fairy favours, down the brook; then
                    when we were going on pretty steadily, just as we had made a superb wreath, and
                    were thinking of tying it together, Lizzy, who held the riband, caught a glimpse
                    of a gorgeous butterfly, all brown and red and purple, and skipping off to
                    pursue the new object, let go her hold; so all our treasures were abroad again.
                    At last, however, by dint of taking a branch of alder as a substitute for Lizzy,
                    and hanging the basket in a pollard-ash, out of sight of May, the cowslip-ball
                    was finished. What a concentration of fragrance and beauty it was! golden and
                    sweet to satiety! rich to sight, and touch, and smell! Lizzy was enchanted, and
                    ran off with her prize, hiding amongst the trees in the very coyness of ecstacy,
                    as if <pb n="140"/>any human eye, even mine, would be a restraint on her
                    innocent raptures.</p>
                <p>In the mean while I sate listening, not to my enemy the cuckoo, but to a whole
                    concert of nightingales, scarcely interrupted by any meaner bird, answering and
                    vying with each other in those short delicious strains which are to the ear as
                    roses to the eye; those snatches of lovely sound which come across us as airs
                    from heaven. Pleasant thoughts, delightful associations, awoke as I listened;
                    and almost unconsciously I repeated to myself the beautiful story of the Lutist
                    and the Nightingale, from Ford’s Lover’s Melancholy. Here it is. Is there in
                    English poetry any thing finer?

                            <l>The sweetest and most ravishing contention</l>
                            <l>That art and nature ever were at strife in.</l>
                            <l>A sound of music touch’d mine ears, or rather</l>
                            <l>Indeed entranced my soul; as I stole nearer,</l>
                            <l>Invited by the melody, I saw</l>

                            <l>With strains of strange variety and harmony</l>
                            <l>Proclaiming, as it seem’d, so bold a challenge</l>
                            <l>To the clear choristers of the woods, the birds</l>
                            <l>That as they flock’d about him, all stood silent,</l>
                            <l>Wondering at what they heard, I wonder’d too,</l>
                            <l>A nightingale,</l>

                            <l>The challenge; and for every several strain</l>
                            <l>The well-shaped youth could touch, she sang him down.</l>

                            <l>Upon his quaking instrument than she,</l>
                            <l>The nightingale, did with her various notes</l>

                            <l>Into a pretty anger, that a bird,</l>
                            <l>Whom art had never taught cliffs, moods, or notes,</l>
                            <l>Should vie with him for mastery, whose study</l>
                            <l>Had busied many hours to perfect practice.</l>
                            <l>To end the controversy, in a rapture</l>
                            <l>Upon his instrument he plays eo swiftly,</l>
                            <l>So many voluntaries, and so quick,</l>
                            <l>That there was a curiosity and cunning,</l>
                            <l>Concord in discord, lines of differing method</l>
                            <l>Meeting in one full centre of delight.</l>
                            <l>The bird (ordain’d to be</l>
                            <l>Music’s first martyr) strove to imitate</l>
                            <l>These several sounds; which when her warbling throat</l>
                            <l>Failed in, for grief down dropt she on his lute,</l>
                            <l>And break her heart. It was the quaintest sadness</l>
                            <l>To see the conqueror upon her hearse</l>
                            <l>To weep a funeral elegy of tears.</l>

                        </lg>”</quote></p>
                <p> When I had finished the recitation of this exquisite passage, the sky, which had
                    been all the afternoon dull and heavy, began to look more and more threatening;
                    darker clouds, like wreaths of black smoke, flew across the dead leaden tint; a
                    cooler, damper air blew over the meadows, and a few large heavy drops spalshed
                    in the water. “We shall have a storm. Lizzy! May! where are ye? Quick, quick, my
                    Lizzy! run, run! faster, faster!” </p>
                <p>And off we ran; Lizzy not at all displeased at the thoughts of a wetting, to
                    which indeed she is almost as familiar as a duck; May, on the other hand,
                    peering up at the weather, and shaking her pretty ears with manifest dismay. Of
                    all animals, next to a cat, a greyhound dreads rain. She might have escaped it;
                    her light feet would have borne her home long before the shower; but May is too
                    faithful for that, too true a comrade, understands too well the laws of good
                    fellowship; so she waited for us. She did, to be sure, gallop on before, and
                    then stop and look back, and beckon,<pb n="143"/> as it were, with some scorn in
                    her black eyes at the slowness of our progress. We in the meanwhile got on as
                    fast as we could, encouraging and reproaching each other. “Faster, my Lizzy! Oh
                    what a bad runner!”—“ Faster, faster! Oh what a bad runner,” echoed my saucebox.
                    “You are so fat, Lizzy, you make no way!”—“ Ah! who else is fat?” retorted the
                    darling. Certainly her mother is right; I do spoil that child. </p>
                <p>By this time we were thoroughly soaked, all three. It was a pelting shower, that
                    drove through our thin summer clothing and poor May’s short glossy coat in a
                    moment. And then, when we were wet to the skin, the sun came out, actually the
                    sun, as if to laugh at our plight; and then, more provoking still, when the sun
                    was shining, and the shower over, came a maid and a boy to look after us, loaded
                    with cloaks and umbrellas enough to fence us against a whole day’s rain. Never
                    mind! on we go, faster and faster; Lizzy obliged to be most ignobly carried,
                    having had the misfortune to lose a shoe in the mud, which we left the boy to
                    look after.</p>
                <p>Here we are at home—dripping; but glowing and laughing, and bearing our calamity
                    most manfully. May, a dog of excellent sense, went instantly to bed in the
                    stable, and is at this moment over head and ears in straw; Lizzy is gone to bed
                    too, coaxed into that wise measure by a promise of tea and toast, and of not<pb
                        n="144"/> going home till to-morrow, and the story of Little Red
                    Riding-Hood; and I am enjoying the luxury of dry clothing by a good fire. Really
                    getting wet through now and then is no bad thing, finery apart; for one should
                    not like spoiling a new pelisse or a handsome plume; but when there is nothing
                    in question but a white gown and a straw bonnet, as was the case to-day, it is
                    rather pleasant than not. The little chill refreshes, and our enjoyment of the
                    subsequent warmth and drynessis positive and absolute. Besides, the stimulus and
                    exertion do good to the mind as well as body. How melancholy I was all the
                    morning! how cheerful I am now! Nothing like a shower-bath—a real shower-bath,
                    such as Lizzy and May and I have undergone, to cure low spirits. Try it, my dear
                    readers, if ever ye be nervous—I will answer for its success. <pb n="145"/></p>
