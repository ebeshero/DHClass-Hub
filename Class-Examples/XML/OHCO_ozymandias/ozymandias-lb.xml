<Ozymandias>
    I met a traveller from an antique land,<lb/>
    Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <lb/>
    Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<lb/>
    Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<lb/>
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<lb/>
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<lb/>
    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<lb/>
    The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<lb/>
    And on the pedestal, these words appear:<lb/>
    My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<lb/>
    Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<lb/>
    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<lb/>
    Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<lb/>
    The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<lb/>
</Ozymandias>
