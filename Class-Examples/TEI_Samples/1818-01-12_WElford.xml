This is a long and complicated letter, and still requires thorough and slow-going proofing against the ms, particularly to be sure of the order of the leaves, and to add notes indicating where Mitford was attaching pages.-->

         <p>I have first been writing two prim letters to
         two prim ladies for whom I do not care three fins nor they for
         me -- people with whom I have not an idea in common, nor
         an acquaintance, but who had heard as they were pleased to
         say that I wrote "an exceeding good letter"-- I thank them! &amp; availing
         themselves of having happened to meet me last week <add place="above"> <metamark place="above" function="insertion" rend="caret"/> &amp; having known <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mama</persName>

            enquire after her &amp; to request, forsooth! the pleasure of my
            correspondence. A great pleasure truly! If ever letters
            were cold-givers such are mice -- Rain &amp; snow &amp; fogs &amp; damp
            air all in one. -- For see, my dear <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName>-- that after such
            a job it was absolutely necessary that I should write to you --
            that I should supple my fingers &amp; thaw my ideas at your
            warm fire -- &amp; yawn &amp; stretch &amp; pity &amp; bemoan myself to my
            hearts content. You always let me come to you for comfort
            in all my troubles &amp; this is one of the worst. Nobody can
            be so awkward as I am at those sort of letters -- I would give
            the world for that comfortable amplifying <!--ajc: I'm not sure about this word-->style which goes
            on so quietly "hoping" &amp; "trusting" &amp; "fearing" &amp; "wishing" &amp; proses
            about "sweet infants" &amp; "dear Invalids" &amp; "happy convalescence" -- turning
            &amp; twisting about like a hare before the dogs -- with as many
            words as a City Orator &amp; as few ideas as the board he bethumps.
            I would give the world for this sort of prosing &amp; mine happens to
            be different -- I write as bad perhaps but in another way --</p><pb/>

               The most satisfactory thing in both these books is the impression
